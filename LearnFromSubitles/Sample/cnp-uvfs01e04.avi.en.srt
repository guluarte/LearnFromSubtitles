1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:09,300
ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN

2
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:36,483
The money !

3
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:45,001
They said 1,200 !

4
00:00:45,002 --> 00:00:47,102
I only have that. I was wrong just now.

5
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:49,608
That's already a lot of money.

6
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:53,529
Here. Good luck.

7
00:00:53,672 --> 00:00:56,950
Monsieur, we need to save some money
for the train to Marseille.

8
00:00:57,093 --> 00:00:58,906
Just leave me enough for tickets.

9
00:00:58,907 --> 00:01:01,224
Little details like that don't
interest me. A deal is a deal ...

10
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:03,933
... 1200 right now, or I'm off.

11
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:22,409
There .... 1200.

12
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,761
Too late! Sort it out yourselves .

13
00:01:25,262 --> 00:01:27,990
But Monsieur, we can't cross without you.

14
00:01:28,059 --> 00:01:30,777
Come back, Monsieur. Monsieur!

15
00:01:31,605 --> 00:01:33,030
Monsieur

16
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:14,613
One for the Boches!

17
00:03:14,614 --> 00:03:16,014
One for Pétain, or not ?

18
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:17,715
No. not Pétain.

19
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,668
It's for me. It's all for me.

20
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:23,385
Stop it! I have to go.

21
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:24,718
What time is your appointment?

22
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,272
Eight o'clock at the Kommandantur.

23
00:03:26,297 --> 00:03:28,618
Ah good. I have to get over to Moutiers.

24
00:03:28,722 --> 00:03:30,428
What are you going to do in Moutiers?

25
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:33,431
Mend fences with Lorrain's cousins.
And I'm changing suppliers.

26
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:42,609
You realize.                        If there hadn't been a war ...

27
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,424
I would have preferred that there was no war,
and we were together.

28
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,014
Yes. But life's never like that.

29
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,392
We can't keep meeting secretly like thieves!

30
00:03:57,627 --> 00:03:59,823
You have Jeannine and Marceau .

31
00:04:00,194 --> 00:04:02,747
If Lorrain wasn't dead,
I couldn't have continued.

32
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:06,216
In any case, I'd have stopped if he returned.

33
00:04:06,463 --> 00:04:07,963
I know.

34
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:27,112
They're everywhere today.

35
00:04:30,517 --> 00:04:31,643
Stop !

36
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:35,081
The idiot ! No, wait. Are you crazy, or what?

37
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:37,962
Get out! You too.

38
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:44,166
Hurry up.
Do what he says.

39
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:48,988
Do you want money ?
Shut up. And keep over to the right. Go on!

40
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:55,233
Hurry up.

41
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:01,290
Bring him to the car.

42
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,523
Excuse me. What are you planning to do?
The Germans are looking for him everywhere.

43
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:07,937
We need to take him in the car, immediately.

44
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:10,418
He looks badly hurt. He should see a doctor.

45
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,943
So that he can hand him to the Fritz's?

46
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,844
That.... that might be best for him.

47
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:15,245
Can't you drop that?

48
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:17,346
You can see we're not against you.

49
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:20,147
I can't go to see a doctor.

50
00:05:20,148 --> 00:05:22,239
I could.

51
00:05:23,334 --> 00:05:24,763
Let me see.

52
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:28,031
Marie.

53
00:05:28,354 --> 00:05:30,100
I can't be late for my appointment, not today.

54
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,403
We can't leave him like that!

55
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:37,185
For a start we must get him out of
sight of the road. And immediately.

56
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,707
I know a cabin nearby.

57
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,706
Watch out.

58
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:50,846
Wait, it's a table.

59
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,118
How were you going to carry him on your own ?

60
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:56,649
Good. We'll go.

61
00:05:56,697 --> 00:05:58,297
We'll go and inform a doctor.
No!

62
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:00,234
She stays here.

63
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,721
Well, I need to clean the wound anyway.

64
00:06:08,704 --> 00:06:11,204
Otherwise it'll get infected
and then he'll be done for.

65
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:14,137
Is your meeting far?

66
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,913
No, two or three papers to sign. Just 5 minutes

67
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,622
Maybe you could go to Docteur Larcher ?

68
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:20,380
He's the Mayor, Marie.
He won't treat a pilot.

69
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:23,221
The Mayor is not to come here. OK.
He's not to come here.

70
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:27,179
Well, if you went to see Docteur Morelle, he'd come.

71
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:30,012
Good. I'll fix it.

72
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:33,632
You're OK ?
Yes.

73
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:50,499
Against the London and Vichy profiteers.
Against abusive requisitions.
Join the COMMUNISTS

74
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,806
Gustave, you're done ?

75
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:58,348
Then hurry up. Get rid of it.

76
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,887
What are all these letters?

77
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:03,838
Nothing.

78
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:06,951
Come on !

79
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:08,676
We're already late.

80
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:13,764
Are we going ?

81
00:07:20,078 --> 00:07:22,578
Why did you tell me these letters were nothing ?

82
00:07:24,063 --> 00:07:25,679
It doesn't concern you Gustave.

83
00:07:25,704 --> 00:07:27,571
Why ?

84
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,820
Papa ! What?
I forgot my copybook.

85
00:07:40,485 --> 00:07:44,941
It can't be true, Gustave !
Yesterday it was your pencil case, today your notebook.

86
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,155
I don't have time to go back home.

87
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,680
I'm already late.

88
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:51,885
But I'm going to be in trouble with the Mistress.

89
00:07:52,108 --> 00:07:54,264
I'm going to make bad dots or lines.

90
00:07:54,342 --> 00:07:58,942
I don't have time to go home, Gustave.
Maman's gone. You have to take care of your own things.

91
00:08:06,832 --> 00:08:08,432
Come here.

92
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:10,231
Come here !

93
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:16,511
OK to get going ?

94
00:08:22,243 --> 00:08:26,843
The German Kommandant emphasises that any aid
given to a foreign airman will be severely punished.

95
00:08:27,392 --> 00:08:29,892
Do you really think there's a pilot
wandering about the area?

96
00:08:30,202 --> 00:08:33,202
If the Fritz put that in the press, it's...

97
00:08:33,727 --> 00:08:35,450
Are you going to sign your name ?

98
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:39,328
It's signed von Ritter, but from the mayor.

99
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,946
Leave it. Maria is off shopping.

100
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:47,144
Yes ?

101
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:48,328
Yes ?
You are Docteur Larcher ?

102
00:08:48,353 --> 00:08:52,398
If this is for a consultation, I don't take
them in the morning. I'll be making my home
visits. Come back this afternoon.

103
00:08:52,423 --> 00:08:55,522
No, it's not for an appointment.
Can I come in for two minutes ?

104
00:08:57,669 --> 00:09:01,036
I've got people sleeping in the house.
What can I do for you ?

105
00:09:01,061 --> 00:09:03,087
I'll show you.

106
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,963
This is my wife, Carlotta.

107
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:10,559
She gave birth in mid June in your town.

108
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,023
So ?

109
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:16,348
She died shortly afterwards.
Her grave is behind the church.

110
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:18,406
... with many others.

111
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:19,807
My condolences.

112
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:23,008
Thank you. Now it's my baby I'm looking for.

113
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:30,809
I found a soldier who recognized Carlotta's
photo. He told me that a Villeneuve doctor
had delivered her, and kept the baby.

114
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,510
And you thought it was me.

115
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:39,111
No. But as you are the Mayor I thought
you would know all the town's doctors.

116
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:40,712
Yes. Of course.

117
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:52,913
Do you have the time and place of the birth ?

118
00:09:53,914 --> 00:09:57,414
The soldier told me that it was the
12th of June. I don't know the place.

119
00:09:58,415 --> 00:10:00,615
And the soldier ?
He went to Switzerland.

120
00:10:00,616 --> 00:10:04,116
He gave me a statement.

121
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:12,817
What is curious is that on June 12th,
there was no midwife in Villeneuve.

122
00:10:12,818 --> 00:10:16,518
You were not there?
No, I was in Besançon.

123
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:19,619
It must have been a passing doctor,
during the refugee exodus.

124
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,220
I hadn't thought of that.

125
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:26,821
In that case, it will be hard to find him.
Sorry, I can't do anything for you.

126
00:10:26,822 --> 00:10:29,422
Excuse me, but I have my visits to prepare.

127
00:10:29,423 --> 00:10:31,023
Good luck.

128
00:10:53,024 --> 00:10:55,224
Look at that. He's already finished everything.

129
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:57,225
That's good.

130
00:10:57,926 --> 00:10:59,626
What was that?
Oh nothing.

131
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:01,727
An enquirer.

132
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:15,728
This is Herr Kruger ......

133
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:19,329
Of our Security Service.
Good day.
Good day.

134
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:24,430
We're going to go over your works.
Herr Kruger wants to visit the site.

135
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:29,731
I thought it was just to sign documents.
With an appointment this morning, it's not helpful.

136
00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:33,032
Unfortunately, I'm only in Villeneuve this morning.

137
00:11:34,033 --> 00:11:35,933
We'll sign the papers en route.

138
00:11:37,934 --> 00:11:40,934
It's a clean wound. Have you any clean cloths ?

139
00:11:46,335 --> 00:11:47,935
What did he say?

140
00:11:52,936 --> 00:11:55,336
The Demarcation Line. The Germans.

141
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:57,937
Here.

142
00:11:58,738 --> 00:12:01,638
The Occupied Zone. Nazis. Ah, ah, ah.

143
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,939
Hold it.

144
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,540
When the doctor's treated you,
I'll get you across the line.

145
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,541
What are you smuggling in there?

146
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,242
I was speaking to you !

147
00:12:52,243 --> 00:12:54,143
Mistress ?

148
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:55,444
Yes, Gustave.

149
00:12:55,445 --> 00:12:57,445
Can I can go and play with my friends ?

150
00:12:57,446 --> 00:12:58,446
Well, no. You're being punished.

151
00:12:58,447 --> 00:13:00,947
I know, but, all the same, it's not my fault ...

152
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:03,348
Whose fault is it then?

153
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:08,049
I realized that I'd forgotten
my notebook, on my bike, on the way ...

154
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,850
... but Papa didn't want to go back home.

155
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:12,851
It's your father's fault then?

156
00:13:12,852 --> 00:13:13,852
It due to bad luck.

157
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:18,353
When we make a mistake, Gustave,
it's very important to admit it.

158
00:13:18,354 --> 00:13:19,554
Very important.

159
00:13:19,555 --> 00:13:21,955
However it's you who forgot your notebook
not your Papa.

160
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:26,156
I know, but it was my Maman who
thought of everything in the morning.

161
00:13:26,157 --> 00:13:32,957
I'm telling you this for your own good, Gustave.
If you forget things, you can't do well in school.

162
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,358
What is it, Miss ?

163
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:54,959
You can go and play Gustave.
You've been punished enough.

164
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,560
Thank you.

165
00:14:21,856 --> 00:14:25,859
You know that I myself have a small company in Germany.

166
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:27,731
What are you in ?

167
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:30,755
Textiles. I have a works in the Ruhr.

168
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:35,280
Actually the works belongs to my wife's family.

169
00:15:09,017 --> 00:15:13,717
We are going to make a detour, Monsieur Schwartz. My
men are looking for a shot-down English pilot.

170
00:15:13,742 --> 00:15:16,242
It doesn't bother you ?
Not at all. You know where I stand.

171
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:21,324
Do you know the place called Les Terriers
near the river?

172
00:15:21,468 --> 00:15:22,568
Yes, yes.

173
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:26,010
It's in the vicinity. You get there by Route D61.

174
00:15:26,197 --> 00:15:28,897
Ah, yes. Yes, ... but ....

175
00:15:29,926 --> 00:15:32,647
I know a much quicker way, a small country road.

176
00:15:32,672 --> 00:15:34,872
It's not very far from here. I'll show you.

177
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:36,983
Perfect.

178
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:40,879
I'd like to see the Commissaire please.

179
00:15:41,546 --> 00:15:44,075
If he's busy, it's not a big deal. I can wait.

180
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:46,209
But it's imperative that I see him.

181
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,670
There's an all-points search notice from Dijon.

182
00:15:59,695 --> 00:16:01,995
A guy who escaped from a police van.

183
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,320
... more than a month ago.

184
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,147
.....very near here.

185
00:16:07,812 --> 00:16:09,951
If he'd stayed in the vicinity
we'd have seen him.

186
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:11,656
Not if he knows how to hide .

187
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:13,832
1.70 m tall, short hair ...

188
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:17,882
Commissaire? Yes.
Go ahead. Enter .

189
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:20,224
Monsieur?

190
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:21,596
I'd like ...

191
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,309
... my child has disappeared.

192
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:28,282
We don't deal with missing persons here.
You should go to Long le Saunier.

193
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,945
Yes, I know. But he was born in Villeneuve.

194
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:37,192
I have proof that my wife had a baby
in Villeneuve on June 12th.

195
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,057
She didn't survive.

196
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:47,792
You have identity papers, Monsieur?

197
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,593
No.

198
00:16:49,753 --> 00:16:53,953
I had a Pass from the Préfet of Pyrénées Orientales,
but I lost it .

199
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,402
How did you cross the Demarcation Line ?

200
00:16:58,427 --> 00:17:01,827
Wait. His wife's dead, his kid's disappeared.
You don't need to push him !

201
00:17:01,997 --> 00:17:06,398
You should go see Docteur Larcher. He's the best
midwife in the town. Everyone knows him.

202
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:08,718
Yes, I know. I just went to see him.

203
00:17:10,108 --> 00:17:11,659
What did he tell you ?

204
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:13,913
He lied to me.

205
00:17:14,081 --> 00:17:15,910
That's why I'm here.

206
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,102
What's your husband doing?

207
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,069
He's not my husband.

208
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,018
I don't give a fuck. What's he doing ?

209
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:26,923
He had a business appointment.

210
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,869
It wasn't supposed to take long,
but apparently it did.

211
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:33,924
He'll give us up to the Boches.

212
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:36,817
No. That's not possible.

213
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,495
I should go for a doctor myself.

214
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,382
Don't you move. Stay there.

215
00:17:52,811 --> 00:17:54,586
I'm sorry.

216
00:17:54,586 --> 00:17:57,340
Do you think it's my fault.
It was me who told you to go this way.

217
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,441
I never imagined there would be so much mud.

218
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,780
However, you must know the area well !

219
00:18:01,805 --> 00:18:06,973
According to your Napoleon, mud
is what wins or loses battles...

220
00:18:07,172 --> 00:18:09,072
... or according to Clausewitz .

221
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,023
I believe we need to push, Monsieur Schwartz.

222
00:18:20,456 --> 00:18:22,256
Listen. In time of war we have to make do.

223
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,319
Here we go. If it was only the war !

224
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:45,048
I don't know what the Germans are up to today.
There are checkpoints everywhere!

225
00:18:45,073 --> 00:18:48,315
What's more I queued for nothing.
Because they want us to come back another day.

226
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,384
Things not going well ?

227
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,233
There's a letter from the Academy.

228
00:18:55,126 --> 00:18:57,226
Oh, but perhaps it doesn't relate to you.

229
00:18:57,544 --> 00:19:00,044
If you're as worried as that,
you've only to open it.

230
00:19:00,156 --> 00:19:05,216
It was addressed to you. It was poorly sealed
so I saw inside. It revokes my licence.

231
00:19:06,882 --> 00:19:09,276
Revocation by letter is impossible, Lucienne .

232
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,389
It's a mistake, you've misread it.

233
00:19:33,354 --> 00:19:34,691
Don't worry.

234
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:36,362
You're not revoked.

235
00:19:36,855 --> 00:19:37,855
Not revoked ?

236
00:19:38,683 --> 00:19:39,883
No.

237
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:43,791
I am.

238
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,500
Because of me ?
Oh no!

239
00:19:50,801 --> 00:19:52,585
Because I'm Jewish.

240
00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:06,631
A law was passed at the start of the month.
All Jewish officials .. But ... I ...

241
00:20:08,544 --> 00:20:10,519
I didn't think that...

242
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:13,391
I didn't think...

243
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:17,423
There's surely a means of protest.

244
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:19,461
We'll write to Maréchal Pétain.

245
00:20:20,121 --> 00:20:23,021
It's the Maréchal who signed
the law in question, Lucienne.

246
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:26,839
I'm sorry.

247
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:32,683
They've given me two months to leave.

248
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:37,556
... but that, I'm not sure ...

249
00:20:42,461 --> 00:20:44,361
I'll see ...

250
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,715
I'll see .

251
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:57,012
I ... I'm really sorry.

252
00:20:57,037 --> 00:20:59,237
Yes. But you've already said that.

253
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:01,245
Excuse me.

254
00:21:04,148 --> 00:21:05,848
Our Father who art in heaven...

255
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:08,049
...hallowed be thy name ...

256
00:21:16,569 --> 00:21:18,096
He mustn't fall asleep !

257
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:19,953
Give me some alcohol.

258
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:27,136
Help me. Make him drink.

259
00:21:37,611 --> 00:21:39,202
He's dying !

260
00:21:39,552 --> 00:21:42,053
If you want us to save him, you must let me go.

261
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:51,641
I don't care what you've done. It doesn't concern me.

262
00:21:54,132 --> 00:21:56,532
And I want to save him as much as you do.

263
00:21:58,778 --> 00:22:06,742
So now, either we let the Germans know,
or you let me get a doctor.

264
00:22:48,258 --> 00:22:54,134
Monsieur Schwartz, I will let you go.
We'll visit your factory another time.

265
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,425
Look!

266
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:12,295
Oh, you scared me !

267
00:23:12,568 --> 00:23:14,108
It's early. What are you doing here ?

268
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:15,462
Your husband is here ?

269
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:17,258
Ah, he's in consultation.

270
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,426
Would it bother you to fetch him ?

271
00:23:19,911 --> 00:23:22,051
He doesn't like me to disturb him. So I never do .

272
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:24,399
It's pretty serious.

273
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,733
Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on him.

274
00:23:30,449 --> 00:23:32,533
Can I get you a coffee ?
Yes, please.

275
00:23:32,774 --> 00:23:34,992
Maria, can you get us three coffees?

276
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:49,828
Is there news of the pilot ?
No.

277
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:52,928
A guy came to the Commissariat this morning.

278
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,070
He says his wife gave birth
in Villeneuve, in June.

279
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:57,735
He's looking for the baby.

280
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,096
Yes. He came to see me this morning.

281
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:06,398
And ?
I couldn't do much to help him.

282
00:24:07,136 --> 00:24:09,225
Leave it Maria, I will serve.

283
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:13,575
Apparently, you told him that
you weren't here on June 12th.

284
00:24:13,698 --> 00:24:16,647
So I absolutely understand.
With all these upsets. Dates, all that ...

285
00:24:18,383 --> 00:24:21,552
But he says he's found a witness
of a marriage that you celebrated that day.

286
00:24:25,086 --> 00:24:27,085
Good. I must have been mistaken .

287
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:28,931
For sure.

288
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,513
Wasn't it the 13th of June that we left ?

289
00:24:32,156 --> 00:24:33,456
I no longer remember.

290
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:41,557
Thank you, darling.

291
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,069
It's very good.

292
00:24:51,383 --> 00:24:56,827
Maria found the recipe in a copy of
'Modes et Travaux'. It's based on roasted barley.

293
00:24:57,389 --> 00:24:58,974
Based on barley ?

294
00:24:59,801 --> 00:25:02,982
It seems that everything is
in the method of infusing it.

295
00:25:06,394 --> 00:25:08,794
Listen. This man is a foreigner.
He has no papers...

296
00:25:08,897 --> 00:25:11,097
...and personally, I would have discounted ...

297
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,530
... but Commissaire de Kervern, you know ...

298
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,924
Well, anyway. Check your records.

299
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:22,581
If you didn't do a delivery on June 12th, well ...

300
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:25,471
...then you didn't do a delivery on June 12th.

301
00:25:28,531 --> 00:25:30,996
And if it's your word against his ...
Anyway, you know ...

302
00:25:31,385 --> 00:25:32,898
I'll look.

303
00:25:32,923 --> 00:25:34,171
Very good.

304
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:38,702
Ah, well, I'm sorry to have
bothered you with all this.

305
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:41,033
See you tonight.

306
00:26:01,637 --> 00:26:03,037
We have no choice, Hortense.

307
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:06,821
But as he said it was your word against this man's.

308
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:08,297
But that's not the problem.

309
00:26:08,322 --> 00:26:09,867
What is the problem ?

310
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:14,905
This man really is his father,
and we can't forget that.

311
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,706
Daniel, for me, you are his father.

312
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:20,120
You delivered him, you saved him,
you brought him to me.

313
00:26:21,474 --> 00:26:22,833
I can't Daniel.

314
00:26:23,321 --> 00:26:24,739
I can't !

315
00:26:25,474 --> 00:26:29,277
Listen, I know how this child makes you happy ...
Not you ?

316
00:26:29,997 --> 00:26:31,307
He doesn't make you happy ?

317
00:26:31,332 --> 00:26:33,705
In eight years of marriage
I've never seen you so happy.

318
00:26:33,848 --> 00:26:34,885
That's not the problem.

319
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,510
It's never the problem with you !

320
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:38,962
We must find another solution Daniel.

321
00:26:39,195 --> 00:26:40,815
There is no other solution.

322
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:45,618
From the moment that man
comes to reclaim his son ...

323
00:26:47,262 --> 00:26:49,655
There were refugees there during the birth.

324
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,952
Soldiers to whom I entrusted the mother ...

325
00:26:52,384 --> 00:26:53,640
They saw me ...

326
00:26:53,749 --> 00:26:56,573
De Kervern, Schwartz, even Jean
were there during the birth !

327
00:26:56,598 --> 00:26:57,876
Jean will say nothing.

328
00:26:57,924 --> 00:27:03,502
Hortense. I'm the mayor of Villeneuve.
Can you imagine the furore ?

329
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:05,201
The Mayor stealing a child.

330
00:27:05,226 --> 00:27:06,609
You didn't steal him!

331
00:27:06,634 --> 00:27:07,948
Darling.

332
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,120
Oh. It's all my fault. I shouldn't have ...

333
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,491
I shouldn't have... I didn't know at that point ...

334
00:27:15,596 --> 00:27:17,490
That I couldn't live without children ?

335
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,137
A woman asks to see you Doctor.

336
00:27:23,315 --> 00:27:24,815
She says it's urgent.

337
00:27:25,522 --> 00:27:26,255
Who is it ?

338
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,580
A certain Marie Germain.

339
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:29,405
She speaks of a serious injury in the swamp.

340
00:27:30,898 --> 00:27:32,498
She's Schwartz's tenant farmer.

341
00:27:32,571 --> 00:27:34,593
You know, the woman who helped me at the church.

342
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,253
I haven't seen her for a long time.

343
00:27:40,151 --> 00:27:41,490
Hello Docteur.

344
00:27:42,311 --> 00:27:44,563
I haven't had time to offer you my condolences.

345
00:27:44,825 --> 00:27:46,825
Thank you. It's the war.

346
00:27:47,215 --> 00:27:49,215
There's no time for that now.

347
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:54,442
I'm sorry to bother you, but a farmhand
fell from a ladder in a hut near Les Terriers.

348
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,121
We think he has a spinal fracture.

349
00:27:57,778 --> 00:27:58,746
Can he move his legs ?

350
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:00,293
No.  And he's cold.

351
00:28:01,203 --> 00:28:04,822
We could have taken him to Dole, but if it's
his spine I believe we shouldn't move him.

352
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:07,847
It won't take you much time, just to say what it is.

353
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:19,097
A beautiful family, Peter.

354
00:28:19,526 --> 00:28:20,826
It's great.

355
00:28:25,899 --> 00:28:29,064
I had a wife too, a long time ago.

356
00:28:30,471 --> 00:28:31,900
In Tonkin.

357
00:28:39,758 --> 00:28:43,558
A cousin, a distant cousin, on my mother's side.

358
00:28:44,003 --> 00:28:46,003
Her name was Genevieve.

359
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,044
She got under my skin.

360
00:28:51,115 --> 00:28:53,527
I'm not a believer, but it
gave meaning to my life.

361
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,551
I worked all the time to make
deliveries. I was never there.

362
00:29:02,258 --> 00:29:06,158
I came home on Sundays,
and then I was off again.

363
00:29:07,866 --> 00:29:11,566
One Tuesday I returned home unexpectedly.

364
00:29:12,265 --> 00:29:14,611
I'd never been back before on a Tuesday.

365
00:29:19,945 --> 00:29:24,665
I broke his neck like an animal,
I still remember the sound...

366
00:29:27,273 --> 00:29:29,473
...and she cried, she screamed.

367
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,118
A mad moment, I'd had enough.

368
00:29:51,903 --> 00:29:53,220
Merde !

369
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,488
Deutsche...     Boches...      Deutsch...

370
00:29:58,142 --> 00:29:59,642
Let's go !

371
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,350
Let's go !

372
00:30:09,204 --> 00:30:12,781
Good, don't hesitate with the pricker.
OK.
Put it in  OK.

373
00:30:12,806 --> 00:30:14,299
I want it just so, It's got to pierce. Good

374
00:30:14,324 --> 00:30:16,437
In a couple of days it will be back to normal.

375
00:30:48,288 --> 00:30:50,188
Good day, Monsieur Schwartz.

376
00:30:50,521 --> 00:30:52,421
I thought you were ....

377
00:30:54,304 --> 00:30:56,871
I traded my papers for those of a corpse.

378
00:30:59,168 --> 00:31:00,967
In order to escape.

379
00:31:01,408 --> 00:31:03,008
There was no other way.

380
00:31:07,746 --> 00:31:09,090
How's Marie?

381
00:31:09,528 --> 00:31:13,328
Well. Well. It will give her a shock.

382
00:31:14,988 --> 00:31:16,688
What a nice surprise.

383
00:31:17,634 --> 00:31:19,089
And the children?

384
00:31:19,247 --> 00:31:20,747
They're with your mother-in-law.

385
00:31:22,137 --> 00:31:23,837
It will give them a shock !

386
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:26,101
Ah, they'll be happy.

387
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,150
It's a great surprise.

388
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:32,459
I haven't had much time to think, you know.

389
00:31:34,651 --> 00:31:37,346
We walked. We stumbled on dead bodies.

390
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,333
They still had their papers.

391
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:45,810
We took the jackets, exchanged
papers and then left.

392
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:48,623
You're wanted?

393
00:31:48,648 --> 00:31:52,548
Wanted ? No but if I run into
a Boche checkpoint, I'm done for !

394
00:31:53,231 --> 00:31:55,031
But with the French, it's OK.

395
00:31:56,842 --> 00:31:59,042
The problem now, is...

396
00:32:01,551 --> 00:32:04,002
... I don't know how I can cross the Line.

397
00:32:22,071 --> 00:32:23,332
Right then, where's your injured man ?

398
00:32:23,357 --> 00:32:25,335
I don't know. I don't understand.

399
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:35,711
You're completely crazy.

400
00:32:35,938 --> 00:32:38,248
Do you realize the risk you've taken,
and made me take ?

401
00:32:39,687 --> 00:32:43,171
I'm sorry to have lied to you,
but you wouldn't have come.

402
00:32:43,196 --> 00:32:44,830
Well, of course I wouldn't have come !

403
00:32:45,617 --> 00:32:47,583
This is pure thoughtlessness.

404
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:50,415
The war is over, Marie.

405
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:55,745
Excuse me. But if the war was over Docteur,
this man wouldn't be here.

406
00:33:01,785 --> 00:33:04,021
He's very badly injured in fact. Is that right ?
Yes.

407
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:06,001
We need to take him to the Germans.

408
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:08,279
He has a better chance to get well.

409
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,988
And whose is this cabin, huh?

410
00:33:11,153 --> 00:33:13,653
I have no idea, a guy that I don't know.

411
00:33:23,498 --> 00:33:26,987
We'll go via the Sentier des Amourelles.
It's longer but safer.

412
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:30,364
Promise me to never do such a stupid thing again.

413
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:35,429
Thank you, Doctor.

414
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:40,633
I don't understand why you take
such risks for a tenant farmer !

415
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:42,510
Speak lower, Sarah can hear us.

416
00:33:42,535 --> 00:33:44,447
Yes, well, I didn't say anything wrong.

417
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,071
He came to find me. What else did you want me to do ?

418
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:50,366
Give him up to the Germans ?

419
00:33:50,881 --> 00:33:53,362
Between handing him to the Germans, and crossing
the line with him, there's no middle way.

420
00:33:53,387 --> 00:33:57,143
The Company can pass without a problem.
It's Muller on guard. He likes me.

421
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:00,362
In addition he goes on leave tonight.
He won't ask any questions.

422
00:34:00,464 --> 00:34:02,024
And if it's not him ?

423
00:34:02,705 --> 00:34:04,100
You say they sometimes change at the last moment.

424
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,696
Stop it, do you think I like to do this ?

425
00:34:07,374 --> 00:34:08,778
No.

426
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,801
I just don't understand why you are doing it.

427
00:34:13,331 --> 00:34:16,278
Because in life, when we make commitments,
we have to fulfill them.

428
00:34:31,142 --> 00:34:33,742
We need to cross. The Boches are there.

429
00:34:38,687 --> 00:34:40,480
I'll carry you.

430
00:35:05,975 --> 00:35:07,780
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

431
00:35:29,891 --> 00:35:34,591
Your wife?  Peter ! I don't understand Peter.

432
00:36:38,598 --> 00:36:40,954
Above all don't speak. Just look at me, and smile.

433
00:36:40,979 --> 00:36:43,079
That's good. You can pass. Good day.

434
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:52,277
You've had a good day Monsieur Schwartz ?

435
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:54,033
Very good. Thank you.

436
00:36:54,763 --> 00:36:58,135
He has no Ausweis. He's a technician
that I'm taking over to a subcontractor.

437
00:36:58,735 --> 00:37:02,866
Ah no, not today. No Ausweis, no passage!

438
00:37:03,937 --> 00:37:08,095
Oh, That's too bad. I really need Monsieur Germain.
It's due to a request from Kommandant von Ritter.

439
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,563
I'm warning you. The Kommandant will not
be happy if you don't let him go.

440
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:14,438
Good.  Wait.

441
00:37:37,145 --> 00:37:41,744
Not possible. You must have an Ausweis
signed by the Kreiskommandant. Sorry.

442
00:37:41,907 --> 00:37:43,786
Well, call the Kreiskommandant. You'll see.

443
00:37:44,474 --> 00:37:46,158
Not today.

444
00:37:50,378 --> 00:37:52,418
I'm sorry, but we can't get across.

445
00:37:53,157 --> 00:37:55,376
It's probably due to this British pilot affair.

446
00:37:57,798 --> 00:37:59,198
Now what?

447
00:37:59,223 --> 00:38:00,523
We make a U-turn.

448
00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:04,413
Except that the Gendarme will get excited.
He'll ask for your papers, or worse.

449
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:08,007
The problem is that with the excuse I gave,
we can't try and cross again for some time.

450
00:38:08,776 --> 00:38:10,576
We'll have to wait a few days...

451
00:38:11,318 --> 00:38:13,018
...or even weeks.

452
00:38:17,186 --> 00:38:20,680
You can go across. I gave them big story that worked.

453
00:38:21,225 --> 00:38:24,221
It a present Monsieur Schwartz.
Present to celebrate my Leave.

454
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:26,941
Ah. that's very nice, I owe you one.

455
00:38:37,875 --> 00:38:39,675
Thank you, Monsieur Schwartz.

456
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:42,064
I'll never forget what you've done.

457
00:38:43,151 --> 00:38:47,944
Say... no offence ... you work for the Germans ...

458
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,527
It's thanks to that, that we got across. OK ?

459
00:38:53,163 --> 00:38:55,059
An escaped French soldier !

460
00:38:55,717 --> 00:38:58,317
Welcome to France Messieurs, and bravo !

461
00:39:10,441 --> 00:39:12,433
I'll call you when the bath
is ready, Madame.

462
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:16,270
Good evening Monsieur.

463
00:39:16,337 --> 00:39:19,664
Yes, my baby. It's Maria
taking care of you tonight.

464
00:39:20,128 --> 00:39:22,782
Huh ! Are you happy ?

465
00:39:40,386 --> 00:39:42,815
I'm really sorry to have questioned you just now.

466
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,940
You can't do otherwise. You're doing your job .

467
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:50,521
Yes. However, it's still a funny way
to thank you for your hospitality and kindness.

468
00:39:58,443 --> 00:40:00,043
That man, how is he?

469
00:40:02,528 --> 00:40:05,028
I didn't see him for very long you know.

470
00:40:06,886 --> 00:40:09,468
Do you think he would make
a good father for Te Quiero ?

471
00:40:12,418 --> 00:40:14,772
In any case, what I know is that
you're a good mother for him.

472
00:40:14,797 --> 00:40:18,214
Don't twist the knife in the wound.
I dread the idea of him not being here.

473
00:40:25,218 --> 00:40:27,415
You'd be ready to go to any lengths to keep him?

474
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:30,878
I don't know.

475
00:40:33,486 --> 00:40:35,186
Anyway, Daniel ...

476
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,857
No. There is nothing to be done.

477
00:40:43,282 --> 00:40:45,382
We received a wanted notice today ...

478
00:40:45,752 --> 00:40:47,352
An escaped prisoner.

479
00:40:48,123 --> 00:40:50,029
So he isn't your guy of course, but ...

480
00:40:51,355 --> 00:40:53,119
the description matches quite well ....

481
00:40:53,773 --> 00:40:55,579
... same size, same hair color ...

482
00:40:56,604 --> 00:40:58,595
It only takes a call to the Sûreté at Besançon.

483
00:40:59,574 --> 00:41:00,957
I know them well.

484
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:03,879
And if I present it the right way, well ...

485
00:41:04,808 --> 00:41:06,629
... he'll go to 'devil knows where'.

486
00:41:06,896 --> 00:41:09,754
For at least, I don't know...
six months, a year or more.

487
00:41:10,932 --> 00:41:14,204
And it will give you an opportunity
to make arrangements .

488
00:41:17,962 --> 00:41:19,496
You'd do that ?

489
00:41:19,756 --> 00:41:21,376
Well, if you ask me, yes.

490
00:41:24,087 --> 00:41:25,687
Why ?

491
00:41:29,982 --> 00:41:32,443
Does there really need to be a reason ?

492
00:41:34,537 --> 00:41:38,857
I was raised by my grandmother who taught me
that in matters of obligation, nothing comes free.

493
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:47,569
Well let's say that ... that I like you.
You and your husband.

494
00:41:49,202 --> 00:41:52,392
And I'm sure this child will be happier
with you, and you with him.

495
00:41:52,988 --> 00:41:55,729
So why you didn't you speak up
in front of Daniel, just now ?

496
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:59,349
Because he wouldn't have accepted the deal !

497
00:41:59,595 --> 00:42:00,695
Yes.

498
00:42:01,338 --> 00:42:02,737
You talk about a deal !

499
00:42:02,847 --> 00:42:04,147
There's a condition ?

500
00:42:04,363 --> 00:42:06,963
Yes. Silence!

501
00:42:07,416 --> 00:42:08,969
Absolute.

502
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:13,457
You mustn't talk to anyone else about it. Ever !

503
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,517
But rest assured it's the only thing I ask of you.

504
00:42:24,264 --> 00:42:27,145
Good. Do I make this phone call, or not.

505
00:42:30,746 --> 00:42:32,126
Yes.

506
00:42:34,253 --> 00:42:35,651
Yes.

507
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,592
Darling!

508
00:43:41,009 --> 00:43:42,928
Oh, my darling.

509
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:46,323
It's so good to feel you there.

510
00:44:03,771 --> 00:44:05,662
You've nothing to say ?

511
00:44:08,466 --> 00:44:10,666
You've been 'dead' for a month and a half !

512
00:44:10,729 --> 00:44:12,629
Let me get used to it.

513
00:44:13,812 --> 00:44:16,312
He passed for dead in order to escape.

514
00:44:17,686 --> 00:44:20,040
We couldn't warn you. We've just crossed the goal line.

515
00:44:24,492 --> 00:44:26,892
I'll not keep you any longer.

516
00:44:31,177 --> 00:44:33,170
You won't stay for a bit ?

517
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:38,842
You know, without Monsieur Schwartz,
I could never have crossed the Line .

518
00:44:41,296 --> 00:44:42,796
No, thank you.

519
00:44:42,893 --> 00:44:46,493
That's kind. There's Jeannine waiting for me.
See you soon Marie.

520
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:48,018
Goodbye Monsieur Schwartz.

521
00:44:48,955 --> 00:44:50,844
And thank you !

522
00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:53,029
Thank you, Mr. Schwartz.

523
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:16,907
You know, in your profession. If they really dismiss
all the Jews, they'll eventually run out of people.

524
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:19,718
It will surely settle down.

525
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:21,717
How are you going to manage ?

526
00:45:24,905 --> 00:45:26,405
Excuse me for disturbing you.

527
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:28,574
You're not disturbing us. I'm going.

528
00:45:30,214 --> 00:45:32,014
Where are you going ?

529
00:45:34,397 --> 00:45:37,197
I have just been dismissed in a fifteen line letter.

530
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,350
Not even a line for each year of seniority !

531
00:45:43,556 --> 00:45:45,156
Why?

532
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:49,081
The 'Statute of Jews', Commissaire. Apparently
we no longer have the right to be civil servants.

533
00:45:50,684 --> 00:45:53,004
I'm sorry, really.

534
00:45:53,262 --> 00:45:55,557
Ah yes, I know, everyone is.

535
00:45:59,977 --> 00:46:02,023
Thank you anyway.

536
00:46:06,408 --> 00:46:09,616
Good. Lucienne.

537
00:46:19,563 --> 00:46:21,263
It's okay, my girl, huh ?

538
00:46:27,433 --> 00:46:29,233
Monsieur le Commissaire.

539
00:46:35,273 --> 00:46:37,373
What are we going to do without her ?

540
00:46:38,906 --> 00:46:43,301
Excuse me, what did you come to see us for ?

541
00:46:44,873 --> 00:46:48,992
Yes. I wanted to contact Madame Morhange.
but now that she's ...

542
00:46:50,452 --> 00:46:53,254
You know about the dead British pilot ?

543
00:46:54,093 --> 00:46:55,793
Yes, like everyone.

544
00:46:55,818 --> 00:46:59,652
We have to ensure his burial. The Germans will
bring his body to the school in a minute or two.

545
00:47:00,224 --> 00:47:03,203
So, are you able to prepare him ?

546
00:47:03,999 --> 00:47:06,721
Wash him, dress him.

547
00:47:11,547 --> 00:47:13,147
I'll do my best.

548
00:47:14,009 --> 00:47:15,509
Goodbye.

549
00:47:16,347 --> 00:47:17,927
Thierry.

550
00:47:19,548 --> 00:47:22,248
Goodbye Madame. Goodbye and good luck.

551
00:47:29,254 --> 00:47:31,073
Madame Morhange !

552
00:47:32,053 --> 00:47:34,778
I was wondering ... where are you going now ?

553
00:47:35,466 --> 00:47:37,166
I don't know.

554
00:47:37,469 --> 00:47:40,469
Tonight at the hotel. Tomorrow I'll
come to get my things.

555
00:47:41,056 --> 00:47:43,102
And then I'll see... as I have a brother in Paris.

556
00:47:43,932 --> 00:47:46,805
But I think I'd rather prefer the
Academic Inspector of the other day !

557
00:47:46,953 --> 00:47:48,530
I may have a solution, perhaps.

558
00:47:48,583 --> 00:47:50,183
Escoffier. You knew who he was ?

559
00:47:50,985 --> 00:47:53,851
Yes. The guy who killed himself
after strangling his mistress.

560
00:47:53,992 --> 00:47:56,836
Yes. He had two small rooms
right next to the Commissariat.

561
00:47:57,187 --> 00:48:01,130
That's where he kept her. According to
the lawyer, the heirs are scrapping.

562
00:48:01,155 --> 00:48:04,755
It could last for years. It's not bad,
it's furnished.

563
00:48:05,497 --> 00:48:07,197
If you want it, it's yours.

564
00:48:08,668 --> 00:48:10,181
Are you serious ?

565
00:48:13,673 --> 00:48:15,320
Thank you.

566
00:48:18,014 --> 00:48:21,049
It's kind of you to have thought of it.
But no. It's natural.

567
00:48:22,603 --> 00:48:23,803
Darling?

568
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,147
Oh, it's Papa.

569
00:48:27,761 --> 00:48:29,561
May I ?
Of course !

570
00:48:31,664 --> 00:48:33,464
You look worried !

571
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,606
Madame Morhange has just been dismissed.

572
00:48:38,024 --> 00:48:39,728
She was Jewish ?

573
00:48:40,677 --> 00:48:42,293
Visibly, yes.

574
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:46,672
Well, you might be able to get him
some private lessons ?

575
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:49,525
Especially now, people are looking for that.

576
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,178
I strongly doubt she'd be interested.

577
00:48:52,495 --> 00:48:54,895
In her place it wouldn't interest me.

578
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,531
Darling, do you think I am right to continue ?

579
00:49:05,277 --> 00:49:08,257
But if you resign, who's going to replace you ?

580
00:49:08,678 --> 00:49:13,657
You're generous, humane, you think
of the welfare of others, yes ...

581
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:16,343
Yes, Daniel, I think it's better if you go on.

582
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:19,883
I know this is hard for you,
but it's best for Villeneuve.

583
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:26,969
What do you think ?

584
00:49:26,994 --> 00:49:34,616
As to Te Quiero, I've been thinking.
For months you and him have been my only joy.

585
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:39,327
I'm going to make an official request for adoption.

586
00:49:39,672 --> 00:49:41,591
Ah, but haven't you seen Jean ?

587
00:49:42,752 --> 00:49:44,750
No. I think he went out this evening.

588
00:49:45,061 --> 00:49:51,201
In fact it was a mistake. The man you saw
this morning is not Te Quiero's father.

589
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:55,939
Not his father ?

590
00:49:55,964 --> 00:50:01,544
Jean did not give me details. He just told me
that it was a mistake and we had nothing to fear ...

591
00:50:01,569 --> 00:50:03,269
... and he told me he'd explain to you.

592
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,290
You can't know how happy I was.

593
00:50:31,575 --> 00:50:37,691
There was a Prince of Orange.
Rose early in the morning.

594
00:50:39,784 --> 00:50:45,510
Went to see his page
"Go saddle my steed"

595
00:50:47,114 --> 00:50:51,884
"Curse this damned war"
"Go saddle my steed"

596
00:50:55,732 --> 00:51:03,446
My handsome Prince of Orange.
Where do you want to go ?

597
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:10,503
"Curse this damned war"
"Where would you go ?"

598
00:51:11,504 --> 00:51:18,506
"I want to go to France"
"Where the King has summoned me"

599
00:51:18,908 --> 00:51:26,729
"Curse this damned war"
"Where the King has summoned me"

600
00:51:31,068 --> 00:51:35,790
"Set the hands to the reins"
"The feet in the stirrups"

601
00:51:37,504 --> 00:51:42,139
"Curse this damned"
"Feet in the stirrups"

602
00:51:52,405 --> 00:51:56,612
