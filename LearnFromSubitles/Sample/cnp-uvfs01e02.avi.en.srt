1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,458
CHAOS

2
00:00:48,402 --> 00:00:49,790
Please stop.

3
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,901
Daniel look, he looks like your nephew.

4
00:00:53,902 --> 00:00:55,202
Gustave ?

5
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,110
Uncle !

6
00:01:06,104 --> 00:01:07,904
You're all alone ?

7
00:01:08,205 --> 00:01:10,205
Where are your parents ?

8
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:13,923
I don't know, I haven't seen them
since the day of the aeroplane.

9
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,407
You've been all alone since that time ?

10
00:01:16,408 --> 00:01:19,408
I slept in the woods, there were wild animals
but they didn't harm me.

11
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:21,309
Why didn't you come home ?

12
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,810
I came yesterday but there was no-one there.
Just a big hole in the wall.

13
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:28,211
Perhaps they're injured !

14
00:01:28,442 --> 00:01:32,188
No. They must have done like us.
Left and then returned.

15
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:34,328
We're going to find them.

16
00:02:39,895 --> 00:02:41,675
I can't do more, Raymond.

17
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,715
We can't continue living crowded like this.

18
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:49,316
What do you want me to do ?

19
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:55,217
Where are you going.
To take a powder, I've a headache.

20
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:11,718
I'm getting something from the dining room.
I'm in my own home, aren't I ?
.
.
.

21
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,344
You haven't found the aspirin ?

22
00:03:30,463 --> 00:03:33,620
I'd forgotten, there isn't any left.
I'd like a mint bonbon.
.
.
.

23
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:39,621
Madame, Madame, I've only found
sausage, eggs and a little milk.

24
00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:42,922
The bread is a bit dry, it needs dampening.
Shall I put it all in the kitchen ?
.
.
.

25
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:45,123
No, no. In the bedroom as we only have that room !

26
00:03:45,148 --> 00:03:47,067
What news of the farm. Have you seen Marie ?

27
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:52,125
No, no-one has seen her for a week.
Since the presence of ... She took her children then...
.
.
.

28
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:56,526
She should have warned us !

29
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,733
Old Georges is looking after the animals.

30
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:00,912
As for housing problems, due to the presence of...

31
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:03,954
...apparently there's an office
at the church where they take care of it.

32
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:07,428
I'm going to try and see if I can get them out of here.

33
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:14,329
Hello Docteur Larcher.
What's happening Pierrot ?

34
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,030
It's been jammed for hours, you can't get through.

35
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:20,405
Go and see.

36
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:23,219
Don't move.

37
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:30,156
Good day Henri.
Good day Docteur.

38
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,834
Good day.
Good day Docteur.

39
00:04:38,835 --> 00:04:41,135
We can't get through.
I'm looking after it, Madame.

40
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:45,336
Halt !

41
00:04:46,056 --> 00:04:47,737
Good day.

42
00:04:47,738 --> 00:04:50,538
I'm Docteur Larcher,
Deputy to the Mayor of Villeneuve.

43
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:57,039
I'm returning home with my family. The people
on the bridge are all from the town. I'll vouch for them.

44
00:05:06,018 --> 00:05:07,918
What do they want of you ?

45
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,241
Not the cart. No vehicles in the town.

46
00:05:34,242 --> 00:05:36,042
Follow the soldier, Docteur.

47
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:40,398
First of all I want to go home.
Follow the soldier.

48
00:05:56,177 --> 00:05:58,277
Wait here.

49
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:11,670
Where are all the people ?

50
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:27,763
Don't look.

51
00:06:43,607 --> 00:06:45,807
Why did they do that ?

52
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:50,248
He was almost certainly a robber, a looter.

53
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,150
Follow me !

54
00:07:10,627 --> 00:07:13,379
Herr Kommandant, this is Docteur Larcher.

55
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:19,823
You're Docteur Larcher ?

56
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:21,824
Yes.

57
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:25,753
For two days I've looked for someone
who can speak for the town.

58
00:07:26,332 --> 00:07:29,157
But I'm only the Mayor's Deputy, I can't speak for the town.

59
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,603
It's me who decides who can and can't speak, Docteur.

60
00:07:31,628 --> 00:07:33,956
I need...

61
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,857
For two days they've repeatedly fired on German Forces.

62
00:07:53,488 --> 00:07:55,696
And that's inadmissible.

63
00:07:56,445 --> 00:08:00,131
It seems to come from the church
where all sorts of people are crammed.

64
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:04,558
I'm giving you until this evening
to take things in hand, Docteur.

65
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:06,014
How do you...

66
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:10,588
I consider you and your family
as hostages, so that you take responsibility.

67
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:15,462
Your life depends on what happens
to German troops in this town.

68
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:16,663
Is that clear ?

69
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:19,595
Is that clear, Docteur ?

70
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:45,492
Do you have your insulin, Madame Verdier ?

71
00:08:45,602 --> 00:08:47,402
Yes thank you very much, Docteur Larcher.

72
00:08:48,614 --> 00:08:50,016
Come on, Gustave. Let's go.

73
00:08:58,887 --> 00:09:00,537
Docteur Larcher....Docteur Larcher.

74
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,560
My daughter's very, very ill.

75
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,370
Since the bombing my wife has an earache.
She can hardly hear anything.

76
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:10,304
Go ahead. I'll get back to you right away.

77
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:14,298
Docteur ! Docteur !
 Docteur Larcher !

78
00:09:14,351 --> 00:09:15,873
It's my wife.

79
00:09:15,874 --> 00:09:19,136
I'll come in a moment, Madame.

80
00:09:31,275 --> 00:09:32,775
Come on, Gustave.

81
00:09:39,987 --> 00:09:41,587
Hortense...

82
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,582
We need to leave here.

83
00:09:43,765 --> 00:09:45,493
But the Germans say we're hostage.

84
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,979
We simply need to avoid the main street.

85
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,480
We'll take the ambulance. With the reserve of petrol
we can reach Geneva at least.

86
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:53,081
And Gustave ?

87
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:56,582
Gustave ? We'll take him with us !

88
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,283
Docteur !

89
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:04,684
Inspector Marchetti. We saw each other
two weeks ago at Schwartz's mill.

90
00:10:04,685 --> 00:10:06,385
You were delivering a baby. Remember ?

91
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:07,986
My wife.

92
00:10:07,987 --> 00:10:09,587
It's absolute chaos, eh ?

93
00:10:09,588 --> 00:10:12,188
The priest was killed by a stray bullet last week.

94
00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:13,289
And the Mayor ?

95
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,190
Evaporated. I sent messages to all the deputies and...

96
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,491
It's good you're here.

97
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:18,492
And de Kervern ?

98
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,893
I don't know. Oh yes I do know.
I saw him just now. He was dead drunk.

99
00:10:24,294 --> 00:10:25,994
What do all these people want ?

100
00:10:25,995 --> 00:10:28,495
They're wounded, sick and homeless.

101
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:29,496
Many refugees.

102
00:10:29,576 --> 00:10:32,531
I tried to get as many as possible to leave.
But there's nothing doing.

103
00:10:32,998 --> 00:10:34,898
What do we do ?

104
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:37,999
You should go and get milk for Te Quiero.

105
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,526
There's an infirmary ?

106
00:10:39,526 --> 00:10:42,401
Yes. We've got a resourceful girl
making dressings in the Sacristry.

107
00:10:42,402 --> 00:10:45,302
And we had Docteur Moret.
He left last night.

108
00:10:45,303 --> 00:10:47,835
He was supposed to return this morning.
But he hasn't come.

109
00:10:48,504 --> 00:10:50,304
Maman ! Maman.

110
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:52,205
Gustave !

111
00:10:52,843 --> 00:10:54,748
My darling, my love.

112
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:57,407
There you are ! Oh, my darling.

113
00:10:57,408 --> 00:11:00,208
Where were you ? We searched everywhere, everywhere.

114
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:02,009
I was dying with worry.

115
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,460
We found him by the bridge
That was sheer luck !

116
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,104
We'd stopped hoping.

117
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:24,212
Excuse me. I've no milk and my baby
hasn't been fed since this morning.

118
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,930
If you could... Just a few sips,
if you can spare a little

119
00:11:28,214 --> 00:11:29,616
Yes. Of course. Give him to me.

120
00:11:30,944 --> 00:11:32,444
Thank you.

121
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:35,133
Come on sweetie.

122
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:43,247
There. I'll put your little cover on like that....

123
00:11:43,648 --> 00:11:45,148
...all wrapped up.

124
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:48,449
You're going to be warm.

125
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,650
Are you hungry ?

126
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,618
Is this child yours ?

127
00:12:00,746 --> 00:12:01,919
No, it's Madame's...

128
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:07,853
Yes... They gave him to me. I'm watching
him until they find his family.

129
00:12:08,554 --> 00:12:11,454
Yes, but the Red Cross has asked us
to collect lost children.

130
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:12,955
It's better if I look after him.

131
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:17,903
That's good. Has he taken any food ?
Yes he's had a little.

132
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:23,781
No. wait...

133
00:12:23,914 --> 00:12:25,064
He hasn't had his feed.

134
00:12:25,095 --> 00:12:26,215
Yes, I'm used to that.

135
00:12:26,698 --> 00:12:28,632
Come with me, we need to do the paperwork.

136
00:12:38,576 --> 00:12:40,162
Aunty Hortense has a baby.

137
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:41,813
A baby ?

138
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:43,892
A refugee child.

139
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:46,135
Gustave told me there's a hole in your house.

140
00:12:46,136 --> 00:12:48,280
I'm afraid the north wall will collapse.

141
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:50,231
They say there's a centre for re-housing.

142
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:54,715
You won't mind if I examine you for two minutes ?

143
00:12:54,716 --> 00:12:56,081
She saw Docteur Moret yesterday.

144
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:58,714
He said that she just needed to rest.

145
00:12:59,982 --> 00:13:02,906
You've got thinner since I saw you at Norbert's wedding.

146
00:13:04,856 --> 00:13:07,469
A little, yes.
Does it amuse you to frighten us. Is that it ?

147
00:13:08,951 --> 00:13:11,973
Listen, Marcel. You know we never agree on anything.

148
00:13:11,974 --> 00:13:14,898
We agree on the fact that she's sick
and I'm a Doctor.

149
00:13:15,874 --> 00:13:21,065
You need to get out of here. This air is stale.
Don't you feel it ? For her it's much worse.

150
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:23,308
She's at risk of respiratory failure.

151
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:26,665
Moret said that he was coming by
this evening to give her asthma medicine.

152
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:28,367
Marcel...
I trust Moret.

153
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:30,452
He didn't leave when people were in the shit !

154
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:37,865
But for the little one, thanks with all my heart.

155
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:46,346
Calm down. Return to your places.
Everyone calm down.

156
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:49,272
Get back to what you were doing.
It's nothing.

157
00:13:50,004 --> 00:13:53,320
Docteur...some guys were arguing.
 They were shooting at each other.

158
00:13:53,372 --> 00:13:57,463
It's not serious but people are on edge.
They can't help screaming over anything.

159
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:04,055
We absolutely must retrieve all weapons.

160
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:05,501
Yes. Together.

161
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:10,653
The German Kommandant says I'm responsible,
and me and my family are hostages for it.

162
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:14,043
I'm responsible to see that the German
troops don't come here. Understand ?

163
00:14:14,976 --> 00:14:17,413
If we have to disarm, we'll disarm them. Come on !

164
00:14:18,631 --> 00:14:22,725
You know how to use that ?
No.
Good for there aren't any cartridges.

165
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,977
Listen, put it in your pocket and hold it tight.

166
00:14:25,978 --> 00:14:30,002
It'll give you courage. If there's a commotion,
 get it out. Generally it dissuades them. OK ?

167
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:32,830
I'm not sure I'm the right one for this.

168
00:14:33,142 --> 00:14:36,235
Docteur, you're probably not the right
person but it looks like you're the only one.

169
00:14:36,271 --> 00:14:37,415
Take it.

170
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:41,322
Come on !

171
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:47,505
Excuse me. Are you from Les Essarts ?

172
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:48,518
Yes.

173
00:14:48,616 --> 00:14:50,450
Do you know Marie Germain, Lorrain the farmer's wife?

174
00:14:50,545 --> 00:14:51,910
Vaguely.

175
00:14:52,178 --> 00:14:53,447
Have you seen her in the last 10 days ?

176
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:55,892
No. There was quite a lot
of sniping at Les Essarts.

177
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:58,526
I believe there's a list of the missing or dead...

178
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,652
...in the tent down there.

179
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:16,209
Sit there Monsieur.

180
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:18,385
Take that off.

181
00:15:26,014 --> 00:15:27,476
Marie ?

182
00:15:32,382 --> 00:15:33,523
How are you ?

183
00:15:33,581 --> 00:15:35,448
Getting along.

184
00:15:49,946 --> 00:15:52,398
I thought I was going mad after the other day.

185
00:15:53,444 --> 00:15:54,896
I had no news !

186
00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:00,085
I went by the farm yesterday evening.

187
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:01,679
I was really worried.

188
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:05,872
I left to take the kids to my Mother's,
and I was stuck on the way back.

189
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,516
I was terrified of never seeing you again.

190
00:16:14,497 --> 00:16:16,739
How did you end up here ?

191
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,586
I came to look for news of Lorrain.

192
00:16:18,862 --> 00:16:22,469
And then Docteur Moret asked for a volunteer
for an hour or two...

193
00:16:23,485 --> 00:16:25,655
... that was yesterday noon.

194
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,522
So... Lorrain?

195
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:30,037
Nothing.

196
00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:33,499
His unit had to retreat to Reims.

197
00:16:38,227 --> 00:16:40,274
I think of you all the time, after the other day.

198
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:43,012
Monsieur Schwartz you must forget what happened.
You know it !

199
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,078
Really.

200
00:17:09,064 --> 00:17:10,136
Good day.

201
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:14,109
I'm the Deputy Mayor, with full police powers.

202
00:17:15,266 --> 00:17:18,097
Give me your weapons please.

203
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:25,783
It's wartime. Civilians are forbidden to carry arms.

204
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,808
If you please.

205
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:30,241
No. Leave it in its case.

206
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,585
It's real leather. English. It's worth a lot.

207
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,420
Here you are.

208
00:17:45,345 --> 00:17:46,773
Here you are, Docteur.
Thank you.

209
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,712
Is this one of little Michaël?

210
00:18:21,741 --> 00:18:25,347
Let me have it. At the funeral his mother
asked me to get it back.

211
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:28,616
What courage that woman !

212
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:30,167
She said she was praying for you.

213
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:36,290
On the other hand the Schwartz woman
appears to want to file a complaint.

214
00:18:36,641 --> 00:18:39,272
I believe that little Marceau is doing OK ?
Yes....yes.

215
00:18:39,312 --> 00:18:41,590
But she won't want to let it rest there.

216
00:18:42,657 --> 00:18:44,801
And this complaint is... ?

217
00:18:44,802 --> 00:18:46,752
Is it against the school or me ?

218
00:18:47,171 --> 00:18:51,105
It doesn't much matter. In either case the
administration will lay it on you.

219
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:54,628
I couldn't have imagined that... that Bruno...

220
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,498
That Monsieur Fournier hadn't filled in
the proper documents.

221
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:28,219
Messieurs ?

222
00:19:28,244 --> 00:19:29,804
Feldwebel Wagner.

223
00:19:29,884 --> 00:19:34,934
By order of Kreiskommandant Von Ritter, I'm here
to requisition the boy's school for the German Army.

224
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:37,372
Really ! And where will we put the boy's school ?

225
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:39,932
I don't know, Madame.

226
00:19:46,731 --> 00:19:49,588
Do you have a written order, a paper or something ?

227
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:50,948
No, Madame.

228
00:19:51,045 --> 00:19:56,847
I'm going to need all the keys, floor plans
state of repair and supplies, in duplicate.

229
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,564
I know the Germans. If there's no written
order it can still be avoided.

230
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:05,067
Go and find the Mayor. It seems there's
an emergency centre at the church.

231
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:08,895
Ask him if he can find anywhere else
for the Germans. Go on I'm counting on you.

232
00:20:27,328 --> 00:20:28,518
Good day, Messieurs.

233
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:32,271
Docteur Larcher,
Deputy to the Mayor, and with Police Powers.

234
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,173
Yes, I remember. It was you who
delivered Handa and Yacin's daughter.

235
00:20:39,243 --> 00:20:41,095
Did she finally come out of it ?

236
00:20:41,945 --> 00:20:47,552
I don't know.
You have to give me any weapons you have.

237
00:20:47,945 --> 00:20:49,601
We don't have any weapons here.

238
00:20:49,626 --> 00:20:53,582
Listen you have a dagger,
him a revolver and him a rifle.

239
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:57,849
We've nothing against you.
We're collecting everyone's arms.

240
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:02,148
These are troubled times Docteur,
we don't know what could happen.

241
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:06,683
What will happen to you is big trouble
if you don't give me your weapons.

242
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:13,783
You don't think there's enough disorder ?

243
00:21:13,953 --> 00:21:15,790
You want to add to the disorder and misery ?

244
00:21:15,945 --> 00:21:17,381
Exactly...it's for safety Docteur.

245
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:20,335
Give me your weapons, you can't do otherwise.

246
00:21:20,391 --> 00:21:22,633
You didn't listen to the doctor. Stand back.

247
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:27,114
You're not only shit stirring
with this crazy propaganda.

248
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:30,625
...but on top of that you're not listening
when a policeman gives you an order.

249
00:21:30,802 --> 00:21:32,685
Drop your weapons.

250
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:34,502
Do it now !

251
00:21:34,809 --> 00:21:39,525
Wait....give up your weapons,
we'll forget your names, and leave you in peace.

252
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:42,922
We're all victims, and not going to kill each other.

253
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:50,679
Docteur we need morphine for our two wounded.
Have you any ?

254
00:21:51,563 --> 00:21:54,523
If you give up your weapons, and I find some morphine...

255
00:21:54,524 --> 00:21:56,484
... I promise you'll be supplied first.

256
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,762
Doctor's Oath ?

257
00:21:59,023 --> 00:22:00,144
Doctor's Oath

258
00:22:00,517 --> 00:22:02,272
Give up your weapons.

259
00:22:06,485 --> 00:22:08,240
Give up your weapons.

260
00:22:13,641 --> 00:22:14,864
Take this.
Right.

261
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,558
We've another big problem.

262
00:22:17,024 --> 00:22:20,605
The girl at the nursing station says
there's risk of a dysentery epidemic.

263
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:24,022
Good. I'm going there.

264
00:22:26,126 --> 00:22:28,949
Good day. I'm Docteur Larcher.
Is it you who spoke of dysentery ?

265
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:33,031
Yes. I'm only repeating what Dr Moret said.

266
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,278
You're a nurse

267
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:37,293
No. But I might as well be.
I've assisted Dr Moret since yesterday.

268
00:22:37,684 --> 00:22:41,221
Take this.
Some patients have really severe diarrhea, Docteur.

269
00:22:41,274 --> 00:22:45,507
There are 5 cases of dysentery and
one intestinal occlusion that needs an operation.

270
00:22:45,682 --> 00:22:47,436
What sort of stuff has Moret left ?

271
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:52,298
... a box of sulfonamides,
Eight tablets left...

272
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:55,515
Good day Docteur. I'm Camille.
I think I've got a splinter in my throat.

273
00:22:55,516 --> 00:22:56,783
Let me look, Monsieur.

274
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,949
Good day Mademoiselle, I need to telephone.

275
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:01,269
You've a telephone here ?

276
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,220
Please leave Monsieur, this is a medical area.

277
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:05,446
There's one in the Presbytery I think, Monsieur.

278
00:23:06,782 --> 00:23:08,182
We need to screen people entering.

279
00:23:08,207 --> 00:23:10,480
I'm afraid we'll be overwhelmed quickly.

280
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:12,235
We need compresses and bandages.

281
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:15,806
Yes. I sent Monsieur Schwartz to look
for linen, everything he could collect.

282
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,352
What did he want ?

283
00:23:17,377 --> 00:23:18,877
I don't know.

284
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:21,439
What we absolutely need to find, are sulfonamides.

285
00:23:21,439 --> 00:23:22,639
How many left ?

286
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,303
Eight. Dr Moret searched both town pharmacies.
They're empty.

287
00:23:26,382 --> 00:23:29,398
Docteur, I've had trouble finding you.
We have a big problem at the school.

288
00:23:29,398 --> 00:23:30,725
What now ?

289
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:33,854
The Germans have seized the school to make a barracks.

290
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,586
School starts in two months.
What do you want me to do ?

291
00:23:36,677 --> 00:23:39,965
You're surely can't let the Germans
install themselves in our school !

292
00:23:39,965 --> 00:23:44,695
Mademoiselle here are the sick. They're infected
and dying. Right now your problems aren't...

293
00:23:45,555 --> 00:23:48,083
Do you want to be truly useful to the
population of Villeneuve ?

294
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,383
Of course.

295
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:54,160
Right ! Go to front of the waiting area and screen
the patients. If anyone asks for me, say I'm not here.

296
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,401
Don't let anyone in except my wife.
You know her ?
Yes.

297
00:23:58,426 --> 00:24:03,227
And then start files for each patient,
with their name and problem.

298
00:24:03,228 --> 00:24:06,445
Then make labels. Numbered labels.

299
00:24:06,446 --> 00:24:08,785
Where can I find them ?

300
00:24:09,761 --> 00:24:13,855
Do what you can, Mademoiselle.
Take paper, fold it and add a number.

301
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,101
If they bring you a body, put a label on the toes.

302
00:24:18,828 --> 00:24:23,701
Then make armbands. Give some to the young
girl with me, to Monsieur Schwartz...

303
00:24:23,702 --> 00:24:27,169
.....if he returns, to the Inspecteur,
and to my wife if you see her.

304
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:30,910
Screen the patients. Don't let anyone in.
No-one !

305
00:24:31,106 --> 00:24:33,348
Please can I help with the screening Docteur.

306
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,505
Not in your state Monsieur.

307
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,886
I was an accountant in the past you know.

308
00:24:39,887 --> 00:24:41,546
You need to hold his head up.

309
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:44,813
So... you have a date.

310
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,831
Yes, the 12th of June.

311
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:48,827
Was he dressed like that ?

312
00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:50,598
No, those were bought in Besançon.

313
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:54,060
No bracelet or distinguishing mark ?
No.

314
00:24:54,313 --> 00:24:55,872
His first name ?

315
00:24:56,143 --> 00:24:57,687
Te Quiero.

316
00:24:57,983 --> 00:24:59,945
Te Quiero ? He's Spanish ?

317
00:25:00,653 --> 00:25:03,090
I don't know. Perhaps.

318
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:07,722
That's not a proper name. It means "I love you"
in Spanish. Te Quiero...I love you !

319
00:25:10,056 --> 00:25:12,166
Is there no cradle free ?
No.

320
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,640
Ah well, put two in the same one.

321
00:25:13,682 --> 00:25:15,534
For a few hours.

322
00:25:17,054 --> 00:25:18,906
Where are you going to take him ?

323
00:25:19,724 --> 00:25:22,812
A van should be here to take the children today.

324
00:25:23,662 --> 00:25:24,853
Normally.

325
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:28,201
Otherwise we'll advise that they be
taken to the orphanage at Lons.

326
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:30,004
Come here, Sister !

327
00:25:30,171 --> 00:25:32,315
This other kid looks strange !

328
00:25:40,613 --> 00:25:41,738
It has diarrhea.

329
00:25:41,738 --> 00:25:43,745
Couldn't you warn me sooner ?

330
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,974
Can I cover him up ?
Yes.

331
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,030
Is the doctor here ?

332
00:26:11,031 --> 00:26:12,849
Yes, but...
He has terrible diarrhea.

333
00:26:13,358 --> 00:26:15,717
Docteur, he has terrible diarrhea.

334
00:26:16,271 --> 00:26:17,735
Why didn't you bring him sooner ?

335
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,436
We've just noticed.

336
00:26:30,614 --> 00:26:32,271
I'm sorry. It's over.

337
00:26:32,736 --> 00:26:34,880
At this age.....bloody diarrhea...

338
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,685
You're looking after other children ?
Yes.

339
00:26:49,384 --> 00:26:51,915
Take these two tablets,
and mix them in a glass of water.

340
00:26:51,968 --> 00:26:53,873
Give them a little spoonful for each 5kg weight.

341
00:26:54,044 --> 00:26:55,213
Thank you.
Good luck.

342
00:26:57,854 --> 00:27:00,397
If we do nothing they'll die like flies.

343
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,815
We need to record the numbers affected.

344
00:27:02,905 --> 00:27:04,289
Segregate and isolate them.

345
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,602
And then get the bodies out !

346
00:27:06,942 --> 00:27:08,783
They're extending the graves in the garden.

347
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,582
I'm going to find volunteers.

348
00:27:11,954 --> 00:27:13,721
Does the Presbytery phone still work ?

349
00:27:13,846 --> 00:27:14,904
When it wants to !

350
00:27:15,527 --> 00:27:17,058
Call the Préfecture.

351
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,405
He's a good guy. He's surely stayed at his post.

352
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:24,836
Tell him people are dying here. That we
need food and drugs, especially sulfonamides.

353
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:30,883
And....fresh water, blankets and first aid kits.

354
00:27:31,841 --> 00:27:33,241
Go on !

355
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,027
Germont, I'm going to need you.

356
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:43,844
Inspecteur, we need to get rid of the bodies.
We can't leave them like this, for all to see.

357
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:44,817
Very good Docteur.

358
00:27:44,936 --> 00:27:46,636
Docteur ! You're Docteur Larcher ?

359
00:27:47,102 --> 00:27:50,702
You need to give me something.
I've got diarrhea.

360
00:27:50,896 --> 00:27:53,003
Go to the nursing station.
They'll give you a number.

361
00:27:53,147 --> 00:27:54,341
A number ?   Shit !

362
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:57,754
I'm Michel Bellini, son of Roger Bellini,
President of the Chamber of Commerce.

363
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:02,999
Son of Bellini or not, go to the nursing station
and take a number. Wait your turn.

364
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,657
Excuse me, I represent the Mayor, it's very important.

365
00:28:06,736 --> 00:28:09,911
I've had no news of my family for a week.
Get in the queue please.

366
00:28:10,602 --> 00:28:16,202
There's an incredible queue... I already
tried yesterday but it was impossible.

367
00:28:21,624 --> 00:28:24,077
I've got lots of things.
That's good.

368
00:28:26,447 --> 00:28:28,704
You should take them to the nursing station.

369
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,905
Marie, we must talk.

370
00:28:36,906 --> 00:28:39,506
But think, Monsieur Schwartz !

371
00:28:41,543 --> 00:28:43,343
I hope Lorrain will return soon.

372
00:28:44,308 --> 00:28:45,808
For sure he'll return.

373
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:47,909
So we have no future.

374
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:55,490
I can't lie to my husband, and see you in secret.

375
00:28:56,252 --> 00:28:58,058
I never asked you that.

376
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:00,039
For now Lorrain isn't here.

377
00:29:00,313 --> 00:29:01,813
He'll come back, but he's not here yet.

378
00:29:04,814 --> 00:29:08,214
I feel the more we see each other
the harder it will be to stop.

379
00:29:13,653 --> 00:29:16,615
Be near the bridge on the hill above the road.

380
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:19,367
It's not right Monsieur Schwartz.

381
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:21,501
Just to say goodbye.

382
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,218
A real goodbye.

383
00:29:24,048 --> 00:29:25,648
I don't know.

384
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:33,468
Good day. Do I take a number here ?
Yes.
I'm Michel Bellini.

385
00:29:33,821 --> 00:29:35,721
The doctor said I have priority.

386
00:29:35,722 --> 00:29:37,522
Good. If he said so then go in.

387
00:29:37,987 --> 00:29:39,787
Good day Mademoiselle.

388
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,524
That's... that was Madame Berthier.

389
00:29:46,525 --> 00:29:48,225
She had a son in my class.

390
00:30:07,226 --> 00:30:08,326
Thank you.

391
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:18,019
What's your name again ?

392
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,357
Michel Bellini.

393
00:30:19,461 --> 00:30:22,310
There's another one.
Put her there.

394
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:25,258
I think she's the last.

395
00:30:26,036 --> 00:30:28,036
Well I hope so.

396
00:30:45,092 --> 00:30:46,573
What is wrong with you ?

397
00:30:47,872 --> 00:30:49,372
I'm OK.

398
00:30:49,475 --> 00:30:51,030
I can wait.

399
00:31:18,505 --> 00:31:20,905
Te Quiero, doesn't that mean "I love you" ?

400
00:31:24,907 --> 00:31:27,407
It's sad to end up dying of the runs.

401
00:31:37,737 --> 00:31:39,337
Yes... I'm still here.

402
00:31:52,249 --> 00:31:53,249
Daniel !

403
00:31:55,853 --> 00:31:58,569
He's eaten, but he's ill. He's got diarrhea.

404
00:32:05,952 --> 00:32:07,852
He needs a transfusion quickly.

405
00:32:07,921 --> 00:32:10,421
How are you going to find
a vein in his arm at his age ?

406
00:32:12,112 --> 00:32:14,450
I'll inject him in the fontanel.

407
00:32:15,297 --> 00:32:18,497
Bring me the saline from over there please.

408
00:32:29,003 --> 00:32:30,335
Where were you ?

409
00:32:30,884 --> 00:32:34,484
A nun wanted to take him from me,
to send him to the orphanage.

410
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:36,856
Daniel, save him I beg you.

411
00:32:43,743 --> 00:32:45,543
Hold his head steady.

412
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:47,109
It mustn't move.

413
00:32:53,518 --> 00:32:55,078
On a count of three I'll inject him.

414
00:32:56,745 --> 00:33:00,929
One... two... three

415
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:22,967
He's not out of the woods yet.

416
00:33:23,593 --> 00:33:25,330
We need sulfonamides.

417
00:33:26,281 --> 00:33:28,381
Find him some diapers. He needs changing.

418
00:33:37,873 --> 00:33:39,166
There you are.

419
00:33:39,254 --> 00:33:42,828
Sleep very well my darling.
I'm going to change you.

420
00:33:51,846 --> 00:33:54,246
You know darling.. I don't want you
to deceive yourself...

421
00:33:55,813 --> 00:33:58,122
You're imagining a future.

422
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,203
We can't keep him indefinitely.

423
00:34:01,157 --> 00:34:02,725
I know.

424
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:16,862
Micheline !

425
00:34:26,842 --> 00:34:28,442
The guy down there with the armband...

426
00:34:29,341 --> 00:34:32,212
It's the guy from the other day...
...the one next to the Shepherd.

427
00:34:32,766 --> 00:34:34,766
He's from Intelligence. It's him
that's tracking the cell.

428
00:34:35,452 --> 00:34:37,752
He's young for a guy from Intelligence.

429
00:34:38,401 --> 00:34:40,401
What's he doing here ?

430
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:46,266
Papa !

431
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,080
Papa !

432
00:34:56,966 --> 00:34:58,866
Is the doctor here ?

433
00:34:58,867 --> 00:35:00,867
Is my brother here ?

434
00:35:00,868 --> 00:35:02,793
I need to give you a number.

435
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,753
A number ?... Daniel !

436
00:35:05,843 --> 00:35:07,970
He's not here, he's...
Daniel !

437
00:35:10,256 --> 00:35:12,022
She had an attack, as you said.

438
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:13,653
Here, Micheline.

439
00:35:19,335 --> 00:35:22,035
As I told you, she has to get out of here.

440
00:35:22,718 --> 00:35:24,618
Docteur Moret said...

441
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:30,438
...at least I understood... that if she
took sulfonamides she'd be better.

442
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:31,979
He didn't. You misunderstood.

443
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:34,111
Anyway I don't have any.

444
00:35:34,312 --> 00:35:36,949
I think there are two left Docteur.

445
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:42,479
Believe me Marcel, a sulfonamide is pointless.

446
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,364
Take her out of this fetid air and get her rested.

447
00:35:44,437 --> 00:35:45,837
She said there are still tablets.

448
00:35:45,997 --> 00:35:49,497
There are some, but for
patients who have a real need.

449
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,800
So, if your wife's health matters
more than pestering me ...

450
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,970
... take her hand and get her out of here.

451
00:36:07,854 --> 00:36:10,054
Couldn't you close it ?

452
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:13,067
You really have a knack for messing things up.

453
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:17,054
Docteur. I can't.. I can't continue your....

454
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,930
Please. You have to sign
the death certificate for this woman.

455
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,515
No, It's me...

456
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,156
Docteur ?

457
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,069
Docteur, can you give me something for my diarrhea ?

458
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,131
Not now.

459
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:11,493
Hortense.

460
00:37:12,592 --> 00:37:14,392
What is it ?

461
00:37:15,034 --> 00:37:17,734
Te Quiero's mother is just outside.

462
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:21,004
She's dead.

463
00:37:24,797 --> 00:37:25,997
Docteur.

464
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:31,398
Excuse me. I got hold of the guy at the Préfecture.
He can't do anything. The Germans control everything.

465
00:37:31,399 --> 00:37:35,099
... but he told me that
a medical truck was in the ditch...

466
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:39,000
...near the hamlet of La Vierge.
It happened an hour ago.

467
00:37:39,596 --> 00:37:41,501
Finally some good news if it's true.

468
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:44,878
Shall I go ?
No. It needs someone who knows medicines.

469
00:37:45,803 --> 00:37:49,803
Darling. I've got to stay here.
Will you go and find some sulfonamides ?
Yes.

470
00:37:49,804 --> 00:37:51,804
Go on then ! The baby's life depends on it.

471
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:53,505
Is Inspecteur Marchetti still out there ?

472
00:37:53,506 --> 00:37:54,906
Yes, he's busy with victims.

473
00:37:54,907 --> 00:37:57,423
Ask him to accompany you. I'll make a list.
Give him to me.

474
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:59,508
I've got him.

475
00:38:03,945 --> 00:38:05,737
Your husband is doing well.

476
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,023
He impresses me.

477
00:38:08,341 --> 00:38:09,896
He's a marvellous man.

478
00:38:10,312 --> 00:38:11,935
Very devoted to others.

479
00:38:12,913 --> 00:38:15,613
He has really been the chance of my life.

480
00:38:18,494 --> 00:38:20,665
You've recovered very well from giving birth.

481
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:22,679
Giving birth ?

482
00:38:23,758 --> 00:38:25,610
Well, the baby just now. It's not yours ?

483
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,768
No.

484
00:38:28,823 --> 00:38:30,622
No, no, it's not mine.

485
00:38:32,474 --> 00:38:34,874
You seem to love it anyway.

486
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:38,003
Yes.

487
00:38:41,729 --> 00:38:43,919
Hold on. Over there !

488
00:39:00,522 --> 00:39:01,722
Wait !

489
00:39:01,723 --> 00:39:03,588
Wait, don't move.

490
00:39:13,677 --> 00:39:14,598
How are you ?

491
00:39:14,628 --> 00:39:15,317
You're injured.

492
00:39:15,342 --> 00:39:16,634
I'm OK !

493
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,771
Not bad work for a minder, eh ?

494
00:39:25,134 --> 00:39:27,167
I didn't see him coming.....the bastard !

495
00:39:27,596 --> 00:39:30,096
Are you alright ?
Yes

496
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:33,890
A second tube of 30 tablets.

497
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:35,793
It feels like Christmas.

498
00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:38,556
With that the baby will live, and I can curb the epidemic.

499
00:39:43,477 --> 00:39:45,178
Madame Larcher ?

500
00:39:46,934 --> 00:39:49,937
Can you tell us what became of that child you brought us ?

501
00:39:50,223 --> 00:39:51,427
Te Quiero.

502
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,079
Bloody diarrhea. My wife brought him to me...

503
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,095
We only just saved him.

504
00:39:58,192 --> 00:40:00,278
Can I take him ?
No, not now.

505
00:40:01,118 --> 00:40:02,967
Not before evening.

506
00:40:03,728 --> 00:40:05,915
Or tomorrow, he's still very weak.

507
00:40:06,272 --> 00:40:07,698
You saw what happened to the other baby ?

508
00:40:08,056 --> 00:40:13,856
Monsieur Larcher, excuse me speaking frankly
but the baby has parents somewhere.

509
00:40:15,424 --> 00:40:17,400
In fact they're both dead Sister.

510
00:40:17,944 --> 00:40:21,844
Yes but he has a family... grandparents,
uncles, aunts... who knows ?

511
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:27,422
Listen, once he's stable I'll bring him to you myself.

512
00:40:31,987 --> 00:40:33,718
I'll depend on you Monsieur Larcher.

513
00:40:33,788 --> 00:40:35,377
You can.

514
00:40:41,671 --> 00:40:43,072
You're going to give him up ?

515
00:40:43,588 --> 00:40:45,585
The Sister's right. He has a family somewhere.

516
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,926
Yes, where ? In Spain, in a grave.

517
00:40:49,592 --> 00:40:53,338
Daniel, Daniel. I know you agree with me.
I saw it just now in your eyes.

518
00:40:55,958 --> 00:40:56,758
Hortense.

519
00:40:58,632 --> 00:40:59,511
I promised to take him back.

520
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:03,604
They're going give him to the State.
One orphan amongst hundreds. Daniel !

521
00:41:04,326 --> 00:41:07,518
He's so small, so ill.
We'll give him back later.

522
00:41:12,547 --> 00:41:14,478
Attention !

523
00:41:51,389 --> 00:41:54,625
And now Larcher, what are you doing ?

524
00:41:56,731 --> 00:42:00,931
We've retrieved the weapons and
are in process of stopping an epidemic.

525
00:42:01,535 --> 00:42:03,590
What is that ?

526
00:42:05,463 --> 00:42:08,777
They're official armbands. I'm having
them worn by everyone in charge here.

527
00:42:08,803 --> 00:42:12,269
I demand that you remove them immediately, Docteur.

528
00:42:12,545 --> 00:42:13,608
Why ? You're joking.

529
00:42:13,872 --> 00:42:18,191
The Tricolour flag is now strictly forbidden.

530
00:42:18,635 --> 00:42:23,077
Its presence will be considered
hostile to the German Army.

531
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:30,175
Can't you do anything for this smell Docteur ?

532
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:34,285
It's terrible.

533
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:39,759
We need to evacuate some of the people.
But we haven't the means to make them leave.

534
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:44,815
Now I begin to understand why you've lost this war.

535
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:50,499
Here are the directives of the German
Military Government in France.

536
00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:56,569
You must have them respected...

537
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:59,270
...scrupulously by the population.

538
00:42:59,929 --> 00:43:03,338
The penalties for failure are very severe.

539
00:43:05,367 --> 00:43:07,863
Moreover, according to our information...

540
00:43:07,888 --> 00:43:08,771
It's in German !

541
00:43:08,796 --> 00:43:15,496
Communist émigrés from the Reich...
Austrians sought by our Police...

542
00:43:17,234 --> 00:43:19,397
...have taken refuge here.

543
00:43:19,751 --> 00:43:22,390
One of them is a great enemy of the German people.

544
00:43:25,176 --> 00:43:28,112
If he's an Austrian, how is he our concern ?

545
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:35,416
He's one of the persons that your government,
in the Armistice Convention...

546
00:43:36,566 --> 00:43:39,566
... has promised to deliver to Germany.

547
00:43:40,322 --> 00:43:42,831
But the Armistice doesn't take effect until tomorrow.

548
00:43:43,008 --> 00:43:50,208
Should I close the doors of the church
with you all inside, and not return until tomorrow ?

549
00:43:51,409 --> 00:43:52,513
It's up to you.

550
00:43:52,538 --> 00:43:56,946
Any help given to this criminal
will be severely punished.

551
00:44:15,292 --> 00:44:17,023
He said to ransack the church.

552
00:44:17,642 --> 00:44:20,353
If the guy flees they'll fire in the air once and then....

553
00:44:20,496 --> 00:44:22,396
And then we'll see. I think...

554
00:44:25,054 --> 00:44:27,326
From sunset until...

555
00:44:27,396 --> 00:44:29,126
No reason to support this guy.

556
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:31,270
He's a Communist and shit stirrer !

557
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:34,044
That's got nothing to do with it.
I shook hands and made a deal...

558
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:35,770
I'll not lift a finger, however !

559
00:44:35,795 --> 00:44:37,120
You're going to give him his morphine ?

560
00:44:37,145 --> 00:44:38,825
Unbeknown to the Germans ?

561
00:44:39,994 --> 00:44:41,994
Where has he gone ?

562
00:44:43,749 --> 00:44:45,293
Docteur. I'm tired. I have to go back.

563
00:44:45,294 --> 00:44:49,553
I'll return tomorrow, but I don't know when.
I've the animals to care for.

564
00:44:50,045 --> 00:44:51,345
Thank you.

565
00:44:53,069 --> 00:44:56,323
If they know that we're protecting him
we'll be in big, big trouble.

566
00:44:56,379 --> 00:45:00,579
How will we explain that we didn't speak up earlier.
When they find them, we'll have troubles.

567
00:45:01,627 --> 00:45:04,752
Would you tell them "He's the guy" ?

568
00:45:04,796 --> 00:45:06,172
Yes. Whatever you wish.

569
00:45:07,266 --> 00:45:09,061
But I'll respect your decision.

570
00:45:09,801 --> 00:45:13,095
Any civilian who in any way participates in combat...

571
00:45:13,095 --> 00:45:16,019
... or lends aid to the enemy will be treated...

572
00:45:16,248 --> 00:45:20,213
We say nothing to the Germans,
we give nothing to the Spaniards.

573
00:45:39,504 --> 00:45:42,104
Halt !

574
00:46:37,502 --> 00:46:39,247
Hortense !

575
00:46:50,088 --> 00:46:51,217
Daniel !

576
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:53,226
Hortense !

577
00:46:55,808 --> 00:46:57,908
It's over.

578
00:47:18,472 --> 00:47:20,466
Go home now.

579
00:47:21,448 --> 00:47:23,347
And take the baby.

580
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:14,765
At least we've avoided panic.

581
00:48:16,272 --> 00:48:17,806
Yes.

582
00:48:18,413 --> 00:48:20,313
It's all thanks to you.

583
00:48:22,757 --> 00:48:25,953
I think you're going to have to
assume the functions of Mayor, Docteur.

584
00:48:25,978 --> 00:48:27,478
Temporarily.

585
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:29,755
You're joking ?

586
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:32,152
The Mayor will soon return.

587
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:34,275
We don't know that.

588
00:48:35,451 --> 00:48:38,133
From tomorrow we'll have to
face up to a multitude of problems.

589
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:42,550
Rehousing... provisioning...

590
00:48:42,575 --> 00:48:44,275
... various acquisitions.

591
00:48:46,433 --> 00:48:48,998
Its going to need someone to take decisions.

592
00:48:50,391 --> 00:48:52,515
Today you've shown that you're the man of the hour.

593
00:48:52,912 --> 00:48:54,812
You're sure that it's legal ?

594
00:48:58,025 --> 00:49:00,104
It's a case of force majeure.

595
00:49:21,768 --> 00:49:24,114
I'll have to think about it.

596
00:49:50,292 --> 00:49:52,497
I was frightened that you wouldn't come.

597
00:49:57,075 --> 00:50:02,192
I'll never let anything separate us. Never.

598
00:50:31,674 --> 00:50:34,174
