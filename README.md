Small app for learning a language while watching a movie or a tv show. The app creates a xspf playlist for vlc for watching a video and learning from it.

Plays lets say 30 seconds (interval) with the English subtitles and then the same 30 seconds with the French subtitles and then continues with the next part and so on for the entire video.

Here is a sample video playing Un Village Francais (thanks to /u/govigov03  for the subtitles) first with French subtitles and the with English subtitles: https://youtu.be/bYZYJ8wdJGo  

And the same clip now with French subtitles and the with only audio: https://youtu.be/9Xdr5SuYY7g

For the app to work the subtitles should be named like this for example: 
VideoFileName.avi.en.srt and VideoFileName.avi.fr.srt

For audio only just one subtitle file is needed: http://imgur.com/u0TpHG6

The generated xspf playlist works with the latest version of VLC, after the first install go to preferences and uncheck OSD and "Show media title on video start" http://imgur.com/yPiX0sa
