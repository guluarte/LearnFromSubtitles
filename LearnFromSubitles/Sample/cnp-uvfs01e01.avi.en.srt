1
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,200
THE INVASION

2
00:01:05,002 --> 00:01:07,002
I told you, I no longer have any sulfonamide.

3
00:01:07,027 --> 00:01:09,527
Just be sure to send me some.

4
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:13,365
Look, we could see hundreds of
refugees in the coming days.

5
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:16,516
So I need emergency kits, dressings, serum ...

6
00:01:18,134 --> 00:01:20,567
I know the trains won't be running.

7
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:24,164
Send me a lorry, an ambulance anything.

8
00:01:28,486 --> 00:01:30,906
The Germans have reached Besançon.

9
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:33,833
My God !

10
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,810
It's the end.

11
00:01:35,913 --> 00:01:38,309
And you're still going to go
and deliver the child ?

12
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,410
A baby won't wait because the Germans are coming !

13
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,878
As soon as the line's restored
call the Besançon depot for more drugs.

14
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:48,275
And cancel all visits.

15
00:01:49,013 --> 00:01:51,037
.. except those which seem vital..

16
00:01:52,314 --> 00:01:54,714
What do I tell them ? The Germans are arriving ?

17
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:57,347
No, absolutely not. That will trigger a panic.

18
00:01:57,372 --> 00:02:00,272
You could say that...
I'll think of something.

19
00:02:02,184 --> 00:02:04,390
Papa just called, he says the Germans are in Lyon.

20
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:07,109
The Germans have been threatening for two weeks.
I can't see them coming here.

21
00:02:07,134 --> 00:02:08,534
We'll have to send the boy away.

22
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:11,159
Yes, but I don't want him to go
with the school. It's not wise.

23
00:02:11,184 --> 00:02:13,651
What are you talking about.
The Boches are only 100km away.

24
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:15,567
... but the army can't advance
100km in a day !

25
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:17,547
What do you know about it ?

26
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:20,137
But Maman, all my friends are going.

27
00:02:20,446 --> 00:02:22,991
Are you sure it's not risky ?
A hundred kilometres  Jeannine !

28
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,733
Good. Since it makes you happy.
OK.

29
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,155
Get going. Get ready, pal.

30
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,490
And don't forget your gas mask. Eh ?

31
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:35,303
Madame, Madame. It's terrible, the butcher
called. The chickens are still at Lons-le-Saunier.

32
00:02:35,524 --> 00:02:38,984
It's unbelievable, Sarah. Every time the same.
I can't trust you with anything !

33
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,426
You can use the piece of beef.

34
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,028
No. We're not eating beef on my birthday !

35
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:46,989
Good, get three chickens from the farm.
It won't be Bresse chicken, but ....

36
00:02:47,089 --> 00:02:48,935
I'm not going 20km for three chickens !

37
00:02:49,095 --> 00:02:51,295
But it's not just for three chickens,
It's for me.

38
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:53,760
OK, I'll go there before going to the sawmill.

39
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:57,067
I love you.
Me too.

40
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,316
Marie !

41
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,224
Marie ?
Yes, Monsieur Schwartz, I'm here.

42
00:03:28,621 --> 00:03:29,922
I'm here.
I'm not disturbing you ?

43
00:03:29,947 --> 00:03:31,562
No.
Any news of Lorrain?

44
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:35,592
Nothing since his letter of the 3rd.That means nothing.
The radio says the Post is backed up.

45
00:03:35,877 --> 00:03:38,155
I need three chickens for Jeannine's birthday.

46
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:40,289
There's a problem at the butchers.

47
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:42,189
You're sure I'm not disturbing you.

48
00:03:42,214 --> 00:03:45,214
No, no, I'm just trying
to move the living room chest.

49
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,611
It's heavy.

50
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:48,790
I'll help you, Marie.

51
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,334
That's good... Now you.

52
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:07,453
There.

53
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:10,875
What does it take to move this thing ?

54
00:04:10,965 --> 00:04:12,667
I don't know.

55
00:04:13,077 --> 00:04:17,279
While milking this morning I thought it would
be better along the wall, by the fireplace.

56
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:19,409
Marie !

57
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:22,347
Go on then, pull.

58
00:04:36,006 --> 00:04:37,770
Excuse me.

59
00:05:46,254 --> 00:05:48,447
Have you seen my pears ?
Yes.

60
00:05:49,153 --> 00:05:51,120
When are you going to your cousin's in the Landes ?

61
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:54,130
My mother refuses, she says it's too far.
You're sure ?

62
00:05:54,362 --> 00:05:57,168
At first I pretended to sulk,
but I prefer to stay here.

63
00:05:58,351 --> 00:06:00,851
That way we can stay together all Summer !

64
00:06:00,995 --> 00:06:02,596
Perhaps we'll see fighting.

65
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,280
They're giving a concert on Friday
near St Christopher's Church.

66
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:09,086
It's an organ recital, a fantasy by Couperin.
I have two tickets.

67
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,037
Can I help you, Louis ?

68
00:06:12,356 --> 00:06:15,770
I'll be happy to accompany you.

69
00:06:16,157 --> 00:06:19,657
But do you think they will still have
the concert with all the goings-on ?

70
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:22,925
Hope springs eternal.

71
00:06:30,954 --> 00:06:33,554
I've been thinking about it for months.

72
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:37,101
Since we kissed at Christmas.

73
00:06:37,126 --> 00:06:38,593
We kiss every Christmas.

74
00:06:38,618 --> 00:06:40,818
Yes. But this time your husband wasn't there.

75
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:48,006
What are we going to do now, Monsieur Schwartz ?

76
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:53,115
We can be less formal for a start.

77
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:55,727
No. That would be too strange for me.

78
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:59,266
My God !

79
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:10,079
Monsieur Schwartz, we're crazy to do this.

80
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,758
No !

81
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:42,110
I've got to go.

82
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:46,512
I want us to meet again. Soon. We need to talk.

83
00:07:49,155 --> 00:07:51,055
Tomorrow about 11 am, is that OK with you ?

84
00:07:53,771 --> 00:07:55,671
I'll be in the fields.

85
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,784
And my chickens ?

86
00:07:57,982 --> 00:07:59,649
You haven't given me my chickens !

87
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:01,542
Right, Because I don't have any.

88
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:07,473
I've only a few cocks and two old laying hens,
but nothing fit for a plate.

89
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:29,799
We can stop there. What do you think ? Yes ?

90
00:08:29,824 --> 00:08:32,856
We can get the snacks ready
and afterwards start the picnic under the trees.

91
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:36,093
Children !

92
00:08:37,157 --> 00:08:39,257
Leaders, set the table.

93
00:08:39,546 --> 00:08:41,080
And you others be careful.

94
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,726
Put your things down carefully.
Especially the gas masks.

95
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:50,983
... and there's even alcohol in it...
I don't believe you !

96
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:52,474
Why not ?

97
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:54,127
Because I say so !

98
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:56,931
Boys, calm down.

99
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:58,835
Stop clowning around.

100
00:08:59,988 --> 00:09:02,388
Look down there. There's a gun.

101
00:09:04,683 --> 00:09:08,696
Boys, get away ! It's not safe.
It could explode.

102
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:11,128
Let's go ! In file.

103
00:09:11,836 --> 00:09:13,836
We could go somewhere else. Right ?

104
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:15,825
Should we go farther away ?

105
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,374
No, we'll stay here. It may be a booby-trap.

106
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:25,408
Our people have abandoned this stuff.

107
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:36,911
The Master says the Army left it.
What's a booby-trap ?
A booby-trap ! That would be a dirty trick.

108
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,614
... help your friends.....you, serve the croissants ?

109
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,190
There's no risk.

110
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:16,191
Children... !  Children !

111
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:20,129
Stop now. Stop. War isn't a game, come and eat.

112
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:24,000
Listen !
Look, an aircraft !

113
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,645
Boys. Stop. It's one of ours.

114
00:10:39,443 --> 00:10:41,298
He won't see much of us.

115
00:11:06,023 --> 00:11:07,929
Hello Michel.

116
00:11:14,862 --> 00:11:17,054
Hello Inès.
Hello Monsieur Schwartz.

117
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:18,981
Here, I've something for you.

118
00:11:19,097 --> 00:11:20,576
Good news ?

119
00:11:22,574 --> 00:11:23,774
Hello Marcel.

120
00:11:23,846 --> 00:11:25,246
Hello, Monsieur Schwartz.

121
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:32,531
So we're not going in July.

122
00:11:34,336 --> 00:11:37,536
Even counting the Swiss traffic
I'm short at least 12 thousand.

123
00:11:41,417 --> 00:11:43,680
We'll have to close for at least a month or two.

124
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:45,805
What if we carried the loads ourselves ?

125
00:11:46,028 --> 00:11:47,596
By-passing Chovot transport.

126
00:11:47,627 --> 00:11:50,477
No. What we save on commissions, we'd lose on petrol.

127
00:11:52,122 --> 00:11:56,271
No. It's screwed. Unless your Spaniards
accept a longer day's work without increase in pay.

128
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:59,239
Listen. They're not slaves.

129
00:12:03,183 --> 00:12:07,310
You think I find it funny ?
There's bound to be another solution
without turning the screws on them.

130
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:09,211
Well, I don't see a solution.

131
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:10,912
I've turned it all over three days and I don't see one.

132
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:15,313
Hey. You don't know where I can find three chickens ?

133
00:12:16,413 --> 00:12:17,807
At the butchers !

134
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:19,098
Obviously.

135
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:20,790
Monsieur Schwartz it's the Police !

136
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:27,431
Monsieur Schwartz !

137
00:12:28,144 --> 00:12:29,444
Monsieur le Commissaire ?

138
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:31,571
I wasn't expecting a visit from you.

139
00:12:31,601 --> 00:12:36,101
Sorry to disturb you. Here's my colleague
Jean Marchetti, of the Dijon Bureau.

140
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:38,520
Marcel Larcher, my foreman. What can we do for you ?

141
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:42,021
We're investigating a Communist cell
which has formed in this area.

142
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:45,322
You've nothing better to do right now ?

143
00:12:45,544 --> 00:12:49,193
Who knows ?
Sure I don't...perhaps hunt Boches rather than Frenchmen.

144
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:53,201
We simply want to find the guys
who distribute this stuff.

145
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,574
Communists.

146
00:13:00,272 --> 00:13:02,503
You know they screwed me back in 1936...

147
00:13:02,764 --> 00:13:04,768
I can assure you they're no longer in the company.

148
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:08,034
Here is one of your price lists.
You print them here I suppose.

149
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:13,323
And if you compare it with this leaflet you'll
see they were printed on the same machine.

150
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,720
With ink missing, there.....and there.

151
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:23,989
So you've a cell here,
printing and distributing leaflets.

152
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:26,766
This is serious.

153
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:29,433
It's impossible. I know my boys.

154
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,838
I've spoken to the Inspecteur about your Spaniards.

155
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:34,274
Them ! Indeed, I know them less well.

156
00:13:35,084 --> 00:13:37,784
Yes. They're Republican refugees I suppose ?

157
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,277
Docteur Larcher ?

158
00:13:46,338 --> 00:13:47,838
Why did you come ?

159
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,139
You didn't know one of your
workers is giving birth ?

160
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,540
Yes, Of course.

161
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,641
So. Is it going well ?

162
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:54,846
It would go well if she started to push.

163
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:57,374
The Police. They want to close the barracks.

164
00:13:57,858 --> 00:13:59,945
Go on. Don't worry. It won't take long.

165
00:14:00,168 --> 00:14:01,469
Translate please.

166
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,116
My friends.

167
00:14:11,808 --> 00:14:14,608
Push.

168
00:14:14,657 --> 00:14:15,857
Good day Docteur.

169
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:19,082
Push. It's going well.

170
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,250
It could go better.

171
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:23,251
Stand up please.

172
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:26,184
You know the Germans reached Besançon ?

173
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:28,980
The Sous-Préfet told me we're
preparing a massive counter attack.

174
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,486
Let's go Madame. We need to get the baby out.

175
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:35,055
Where's the interpreter, Ignacio ?

176
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:40,681
That's not a flag, is it ?

177
00:14:58,087 --> 00:14:59,916
They're Communists.

178
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,889
It's in Spanish.

179
00:15:06,842 --> 00:15:11,142
These are old things, January 39, March 39...

180
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,271
The printing machine !

181
00:15:13,402 --> 00:15:14,835
Where's the stuff ?

182
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:19,562
The cops are here and know that we print it here.
Shit !

183
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:23,571
Pass me the stencils.

184
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,277
They won't take long to tumble to it.

185
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,219
What else is there ?

186
00:15:30,969 --> 00:15:32,917
There's the Bolshevism books.

187
00:15:43,662 --> 00:15:45,962
The Politburo pamphlets too.

188
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,029
What do we do ? Do we pack the trunk ?

189
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,354
With the Teutons around, I don't see where I'll go.

190
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:00,248
Hurry up....go quietly.

191
00:16:16,471 --> 00:16:18,603
Him again.

192
00:16:20,122 --> 00:16:22,785
Hey, don't you want us
to go with the others?

193
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,558
If we get demerit points for start
of school, my mother will kill me.

194
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:30,787
Don't do it. The Master's very busy already.

195
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,622
What's he looking for ?

196
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:45,154
Shit.

197
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:49,496
 It's a Boche ! They're going to shoot us !

198
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:23,975
Are you OK, children ?

199
00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:28,176
Don't move.

200
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:30,281
Bruno ?

201
00:17:31,131 --> 00:17:32,831
Don't move, children.

202
00:17:32,856 --> 00:17:33,956
Bruno ?

203
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:38,465
Bruno !
Yes ?

204
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:44,623
Marceau, You're bleeding darling.

205
00:17:46,204 --> 00:17:47,650
I'm hurt !

206
00:17:48,014 --> 00:17:49,867
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.

207
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,879
Is he dead ?

208
00:17:57,047 --> 00:18:01,847
Bruno .... Bruno.... Bruno. ?
What happened ?

209
00:18:03,534 --> 00:18:04,534
Michaël.

210
00:18:26,224 --> 00:18:27,243
What shall we do Mistress ?

211
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,293
Don't move.

212
00:18:28,318 --> 00:18:29,624
Don't move.

213
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,491
It's OK children. Don't move.

214
00:18:34,523 --> 00:18:35,915
Get back.

215
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,743
They'll come and get us.

216
00:18:57,985 --> 00:18:59,985
I'm sure Marcel has an explanation.

217
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:02,375
Apart from him, who has access to this machine ?

218
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,600
I don't know, Inès, my secretary, just about everyone.

219
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:10,493
What was that ?

220
00:19:10,494 --> 00:19:12,594
I don't know. It felt like an explosion !

221
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,307
What was it ?

222
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:21,232
They said an explosion up on the hill.

223
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,700
The Germans !

224
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,289
The Germans !

225
00:19:30,489 --> 00:19:32,389
I think I saw tanks.

226
00:19:56,247 --> 00:19:58,447
My God ! Quick, quick.

227
00:20:54,924 --> 00:20:57,124
You must go home, and then leave Villeneuve.

228
00:20:57,442 --> 00:20:59,542
I can't. There's the woman with the baby.

229
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:05,579
Marcel, would you oblige. Go to my house.
Tell Hortense to close the shutters and wait for me.

230
00:21:05,604 --> 00:21:06,804
I'm not at your disposal !

231
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:08,905
Stop that, damnit. Your brother is stuck here.

232
00:21:08,906 --> 00:21:09,606
You and your dramas.

233
00:21:09,607 --> 00:21:11,807
I've got a wife too... and she's sick.

234
00:21:11,975 --> 00:21:13,775
And I've to go find my kid at the school.

235
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:17,375
Good. Don't worry yourself. I'll go.

236
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:19,110
Can you take me ?

237
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:21,635
Who cares about the Communists now, OK ?

238
00:21:22,088 --> 00:21:24,055
The tanks are going towards Villeneuve.
There'll be panic there.

239
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,674
We need to go, quick.

240
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,231
Help me ! Help me !

241
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:35,349
What are you doing Madame ? Lie down.
You can't get up.

242
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:37,185
Lie down, Madame.

243
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:49,417
Push here. Hard. Hard !

244
00:21:55,418 --> 00:21:56,718
Come on, Madame.

245
00:21:57,186 --> 00:21:58,786
Push. Come on.

246
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:05,159
It's good. I see it. I can see it's head.

247
00:22:05,383 --> 00:22:08,301
Go on, push. It's coming. One more effort.

248
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:13,146
Ah, there it is.

249
00:22:19,623 --> 00:22:21,223
It's a boy, Madame.

250
00:22:21,827 --> 00:22:23,727
A beautiful boy.

251
00:22:34,836 --> 00:22:36,836
He's beautiful. What are you going to call him ?

252
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:38,765
"Te Quiero"  (I love you)

253
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:40,592
"Te Quiero" ? Right, "Te Quiero".

254
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:43,128
He's beautiful is "Te Quiero".

255
00:22:44,247 --> 00:22:45,983
Bravo, Madame.

256
00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:52,009
Shit ! She's going.
She's having an haemorrhage. Quick.

257
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,888
Help me. In my kit there.

258
00:22:54,913 --> 00:22:56,713
In the pocket on the left there's a syringe.

259
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:58,833
Get it out.

260
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:00,134
Take the needle.

261
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:02,699
There's a little bottle at the bottom.

262
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,195
Disinfect it with alcohol.

263
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,837
Go on. Pull the syringe. Suck up all the liquid.

264
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:10,199
Madame, Madame !

265
00:23:12,105 --> 00:23:14,739
She's having a cardiac failure.
We need to get her to hospital.

266
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,440
Can you look after the baby ?

267
00:23:16,441 --> 00:23:18,141
No, I don't know how. It's....

268
00:23:18,142 --> 00:23:20,142
My God, I need help.

269
00:23:20,143 --> 00:23:22,943
She's a Comrade who landed on our doorstep.
Now a baby. No !

270
00:23:26,944 --> 00:23:28,944
Come close to me children.

271
00:23:28,945 --> 00:23:30,445
Come close to me.

272
00:23:36,446 --> 00:23:38,746
It's OK, Marceau, come close to me.

273
00:23:39,747 --> 00:23:41,672
I want to go home.

274
00:23:42,198 --> 00:23:44,093
It's only a scratch. Come on.

275
00:23:44,647 --> 00:23:47,047
Your parents are going to come and look for us.
Don't worry.

276
00:23:47,938 --> 00:23:49,838
They're going to come and look for us.

277
00:23:56,766 --> 00:23:58,651
How many boys were there this morning ?

278
00:23:58,652 --> 00:24:00,052
I don't know Mistress.

279
00:24:01,156 --> 00:24:07,305
I know. There were 11, Mistress. Marinette said
there were 8 of us and 11 of them, and that..

280
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,659
there were 3 boys
who were going to get bored.

281
00:24:10,064 --> 00:24:12,164
Yes, OK.

282
00:24:12,856 --> 00:24:15,456
Get up. Stand in row. In line.

283
00:24:15,774 --> 00:24:18,349
Boys on one side there, girls on the other.

284
00:24:18,482 --> 00:24:20,182
Marceau, you stay with me.

285
00:24:20,722 --> 00:24:22,071
Come on

286
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:25,184
Come forward.

287
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:39,077
We're missing one !

288
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:40,672
We're missing one !

289
00:24:40,697 --> 00:24:42,697
We're missing one !
Gustave is missing.

290
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:45,053
Gustave. Gustave !

291
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:52,868
Come on, Marceau.
How can we go without Gustave ?

292
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:56,220
I don't know.

293
00:24:56,299 --> 00:25:01,779
Where's Gustave.
Gustave. Gustave. Gustave. ...

294
00:25:26,684 --> 00:25:28,684
Hey. Where did you come from ?

295
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,227
Are you frightened ? What's happened ?

296
00:25:32,846 --> 00:25:34,380
I was lost.

297
00:25:34,793 --> 00:25:36,693
You were lost where ?

298
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:40,971
I was with the class...

299
00:25:41,186 --> 00:25:43,686
... then I ran away and I was lost.

300
00:25:46,448 --> 00:25:48,976
Me too....I've been lost for a long time.

301
00:25:49,389 --> 00:25:51,110
What's your name ?

302
00:25:51,135 --> 00:25:52,517
Gustave.

303
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:54,642
Mine's Jacques.

304
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:56,553
You're not lost now. I've found you.

305
00:25:56,578 --> 00:25:58,294
What's your spike called ?

306
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,388
My what ?
The town where your school is.

307
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:03,683
Villeneuve.

308
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:05,207
And where is Villeneuve ?

309
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:08,063
I don't know....over there.

310
00:26:10,591 --> 00:26:12,329
Let's go, come on.

311
00:26:15,143 --> 00:26:18,443
Didn't they teach you at school to listen to adults.

312
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:21,423
Eh ?   Let's go.

313
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:32,329
How could you do this to me with the leaflets ?

314
00:26:33,386 --> 00:26:34,686
What leaflets ?

315
00:26:35,273 --> 00:26:38,847
Listen. There's only you and Madame Inès who
know how to use the spirit printing machine.

316
00:26:39,788 --> 00:26:42,497
And I don't see Madame Inès as a Bolshevik.

317
00:26:43,989 --> 00:26:46,272
I don't give a damn about your political opinions.

318
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:48,739
... as long as they don't spill over into work.

319
00:26:49,391 --> 00:26:53,091
But to spread propaganda at
the sawmill, right now, frankly...

320
00:26:54,551 --> 00:26:56,651
I'm not a Communist.

321
00:26:56,676 --> 00:26:59,176
But if my brother asks me to go and warn his wife...

322
00:27:02,327 --> 00:27:05,627
Monsieur Schwartz you can't compare
family with politics.

323
00:27:08,772 --> 00:27:10,995
Shit. Refugees !

324
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,890
No, it's Gustave's class.

325
00:27:18,024 --> 00:27:19,905
Papa !

326
00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:21,880
Papa !
Marceau !

327
00:27:21,979 --> 00:27:22,979
What happened ?

328
00:27:23,004 --> 00:27:25,504
There was a plane. It fired on us Papa.

329
00:27:25,601 --> 00:27:27,001
Some of the kids died.

330
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:29,002
You're bleeding ?

331
00:27:29,003 --> 00:27:30,703
It's nothing.

332
00:27:30,704 --> 00:27:32,504
Michaël is dead.

333
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:42,995
Gustave.

334
00:27:43,015 --> 00:27:45,315
It's not him. It's not Gustave.

335
00:27:48,003 --> 00:27:52,107
It's not him. He was frightened.
He had to run. We looked for him everywhere.

336
00:27:52,108 --> 00:27:54,208
He's not injured. If so, we'd have seen him.

337
00:27:54,209 --> 00:27:55,879
Where is he then ?

338
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,446
Where is he ?

339
00:27:58,838 --> 00:28:00,199
He ran away.

340
00:28:00,456 --> 00:28:02,636
Don't worry darling. They're going to find him
and take care of him.

341
00:28:03,693 --> 00:28:06,193
Give me as many children as possible.

342
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:14,593
Good. Who's going with Monsieur Schwartz ?
You, you... you...

343
00:28:14,885 --> 00:28:16,585
He has to have gone home.

344
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:18,027
It's not far.

345
00:28:18,725 --> 00:28:20,075
Go on. Go on

346
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:21,916
The rest of you, stay close to me.

347
00:28:22,187 --> 00:28:24,795
Don't worry, they're going to come back with help. OK

348
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:28,096
 Come on.

349
00:28:31,486 --> 00:28:34,009
Madame ! Open your eyes, Madame.

350
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,338
Stay awake, Madame.

351
00:28:37,668 --> 00:28:39,568
You mustn't sleep.

352
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,335
I'm a doctor.     I'm a doctor.

353
00:28:53,748 --> 00:28:55,002
 Sergeant !

354
00:28:55,304 --> 00:28:58,904
I've a patient who's haemorrhaged during labour.
She needs to be taken urgently to St Vincent Hospital.

355
00:28:59,424 --> 00:29:00,624
There no longer is a hospital !

356
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,325
It was evacuated this morning.

357
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,279
But in the name of God why ?

358
00:29:04,383 --> 00:29:05,983
Be calm, Monsieur.

359
00:29:06,406 --> 00:29:08,628
Where's the medical station
of the 56th Infantry Division.

360
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:11,548
They don't use that for civilians' needs.

361
00:29:12,135 --> 00:29:15,435
If this woman doesn't get a transfusion
in the next hour she'll die.

362
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,740
The 56th Division left yesterday.

363
00:29:18,397 --> 00:29:21,032
Except a few regiments which went into Switzerland.

364
00:29:21,033 --> 00:29:23,333
Since the Germans reached Besançon it's been panic.

365
00:29:25,137 --> 00:29:27,210
Moreover they're in Villeneuve now.

366
00:29:28,044 --> 00:29:28,903
You're sure ?

367
00:29:29,112 --> 00:29:32,225
You haven't heard ? I think they
got as far as the railway yards.

368
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,710
There must be a military hospital not far away ?

369
00:29:36,012 --> 00:29:40,769
There's the Army Corps at Sayolle,
20km away. But I don't know if they have blood.

370
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,239
2,000 francs for you if you take her to Sayolle. Now.

371
00:29:51,112 --> 00:29:53,766
And our checkpoint ? We have our orders !

372
00:29:53,946 --> 00:29:56,946
What is there to check ? The Germans are already here !

373
00:30:00,942 --> 00:30:02,342
3,000 francs !

374
00:30:07,343 --> 00:30:11,043
OK ....I don't promise they have blood.

375
00:30:11,322 --> 00:30:13,219
Pierre, Jacques.

376
00:30:15,954 --> 00:30:18,133
Come on, Madame. Come on.

377
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:21,102
Lean on us.

378
00:30:44,356 --> 00:30:46,031
What do you want us to do ?

379
00:30:46,609 --> 00:30:48,509
Especially if she stays there.

380
00:30:50,788 --> 00:30:53,188
It will be safer with you.

381
00:30:54,141 --> 00:30:58,141
You promise to take her to Sayolle ?
Don't worry.

382
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,251
Monsieur, I don't see the house.

383
00:31:29,252 --> 00:31:31,152
Don't worry my dear, we're getting there.
We're getting there.

384
00:31:31,153 --> 00:31:32,353
We'll all get home.

385
00:31:32,354 --> 00:31:34,493
We'll all get home.

386
00:31:36,744 --> 00:31:38,444
What's going on here now ?

387
00:31:46,349 --> 00:31:49,328
You can't go further. There's firing everywhere.

388
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,802
Wait, I have to take these children to the school.
The parents will be waiting for them there.

389
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,276
The best is to go there on foot
via all the back lanes.

390
00:31:54,443 --> 00:31:56,243
On foot ! What am I going to do with my car ?

391
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,372
Isn't there a way of contacting the fire brigade,
or the town hall.

392
00:31:59,397 --> 00:32:03,461
Sir, there's no longer a fire brigade or town hall.
You have to sort it out yourself. Understand ?

393
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:09,438
Park there. Crouch down when you leave.

394
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:12,628
Crouch down.....get out quickly.

395
00:32:14,735 --> 00:32:16,235
Marceau !      Stay together.

396
00:32:22,018 --> 00:32:23,433
Look out !

397
00:32:23,823 --> 00:32:25,468
Stay be hind the car.

398
00:32:25,698 --> 00:32:27,506
Hide !

399
00:32:27,901 --> 00:32:29,201
Hide !

400
00:32:29,432 --> 00:32:32,032
Watch out, watch out. Hide !

401
00:32:33,842 --> 00:32:38,682
Come on. Marceau I know you're in pain, Huh ?

402
00:32:38,713 --> 00:32:39,713
Watch out !

403
00:32:40,108 --> 00:32:41,808
But you've to show an example. OK ?

404
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,469
I'm frightened Papa.

405
00:32:45,494 --> 00:32:46,893
It's normal that you're frightened.

406
00:32:47,051 --> 00:32:48,851
In your place I'd be frightened too.

407
00:32:49,844 --> 00:32:52,644
But if you don't go, neither will your friends.

408
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:55,364
OK ? It's not complicated.

409
00:32:55,477 --> 00:32:59,877
You scoot. You run across while the guys stay here.

410
00:33:02,988 --> 00:33:05,888
But this morning you said it wasn't dangerous !

411
00:33:06,802 --> 00:33:09,717
I'm not going to make a fool of myself
twice in the same day, eh ?

412
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:17,380
When I say "ready"....then go. OK ?

413
00:33:19,253 --> 00:33:22,499
Ready ? Go. Run !

414
00:33:22,853 --> 00:33:25,153
Run Marceau, run.

415
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,583
Run ! Go ! Run !

416
00:33:27,991 --> 00:33:29,332
Go !

417
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:09,010
Where's Maman ?
She's at home darling.

418
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,263
You need to leave, Monsieur Schwartz.
You really need to leave !

419
00:34:24,843 --> 00:34:26,730
Jeannine !

420
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:30,212
Jeannine !

421
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:51,146
I'm going to leave you there pal. Wait for me.
Papa will come back soon.

422
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,761
Jeannine !
Raymond ?
 Jeannine !

423
00:34:58,032 --> 00:35:00,632
Oh, you're back. How glad I am.

424
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:03,091
Maman.

425
00:35:03,092 --> 00:35:05,192
My little boy !

426
00:35:05,193 --> 00:35:06,193
What happened to you my love ?

427
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:09,258
We were with the teacher, and he's dead.

428
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:13,295
I told you it was dangerous.

429
00:35:13,296 --> 00:35:15,696
I told you.
Yes I know. But stop it, he's not badly hurt.

430
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,629
I tried to phone you at the sawmill
this morning but you didn't reply.

431
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:22,454
No, I was... Sarah, what's happened ?

432
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,162
The soldiers, Sir.
Really ?

433
00:35:25,298 --> 00:35:27,898
French...They'd been drinking.
It was horrible. What can we do ?

434
00:35:28,463 --> 00:35:31,963
We must leave.
Let's pack necessities, quickly.

435
00:35:43,804 --> 00:35:46,204
A child's been killed.

436
00:35:49,134 --> 00:35:52,820
There's complete panic. Refugees are arriving
from everywhere. The inhabitants are leaving.

437
00:35:52,962 --> 00:35:54,320
Thieves are looting.

438
00:35:54,802 --> 00:35:56,165
What can we do ?

439
00:35:56,394 --> 00:35:57,601
Nothing.

440
00:35:57,786 --> 00:35:59,277
Wait to see what happens.

441
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:00,866
... and drink a glass or two.

442
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:05,609
I just saw a father knock down
an old man for a bottle of water.

443
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,410
Human nature is terrible !

444
00:36:08,411 --> 00:36:11,111
It's not human nature we're
seeing in this case my boy.

445
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,594
... it's everything else.

446
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,079
Thanks.

447
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:26,122
It's funny that we meet again
under these circumstances, eh ?

448
00:36:26,813 --> 00:36:28,411
You really are in Intelligence.

449
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:29,974
Yes, that's it.

450
00:36:29,999 --> 00:36:31,499
We're leaving.

451
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:34,866
You want to go back to Dijon ?

452
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:38,834
I don't know. Perhaps I'd be more useful here ?

453
00:36:40,613 --> 00:36:42,395
Things are getting rough.
Yes !

454
00:36:45,258 --> 00:36:48,558
I only hope the Boches let us restore order.

455
00:37:04,273 --> 00:37:06,223
Marcel ?

456
00:37:10,067 --> 00:37:11,772
The little guy isn't here ?

457
00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:15,219
No. You have to go get him at the school.

458
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:17,201
What were all those explosions ?

459
00:37:31,453 --> 00:37:33,653
The Germans are there. I saw tanks.

460
00:37:34,226 --> 00:37:35,626
That was the cause of the explosions.

461
00:37:36,269 --> 00:37:38,169
So, it's over ?

462
00:37:41,528 --> 00:37:43,728
It's an Imperialist war in our homes.

463
00:37:44,974 --> 00:37:48,783
The London bankers versus the Berlin bankers.
Who cares who wins or loses.

464
00:37:49,963 --> 00:37:51,659
Anyway !

465
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:54,643
The Nazis here...!

466
00:37:54,796 --> 00:37:56,278
You haven't taken your asthma medicine ?

467
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,520
Yes.

468
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,303
...but with the heat and humidity...

469
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:03,104
You should go to the school, you know.

470
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,446
Marcel, what's happened ?

471
00:38:15,615 --> 00:38:17,315
The little one...

472
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:19,670
.. it's not serious.

473
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:22,546
But during the walk to the picnic...

474
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,810
I'm telling you, it's not serious.

475
00:38:26,143 --> 00:38:28,843
There was a problem,
For now we don't know where he is.

476
00:38:29,694 --> 00:38:31,794
He wasn't injured, or he would have been found.

477
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:34,068
He must be afraid of the noise of the fighting.

478
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:36,235
He has to have hidden.

479
00:38:36,307 --> 00:38:38,076
We'll find him.

480
00:38:43,662 --> 00:38:45,844
My little boy.

481
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:49,011
He's smart. He's going to get out of it.

482
00:38:56,893 --> 00:38:58,928
It's OK. You can come.

483
00:39:02,765 --> 00:39:05,765
Come on. Come on.

484
00:39:21,035 --> 00:39:23,966
Do we have to go far ?
I don't know where we're going.

485
00:39:26,604 --> 00:39:27,847
What does your father do ?

486
00:39:27,984 --> 00:39:29,684
He works with wood, making boards.

487
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:34,275
Boards are good. With boards you can make a coffin.
You know that. Huh ?

488
00:39:37,554 --> 00:39:39,679
And you, what do you do ?

489
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:41,453
Stay there.

490
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:46,493
Don't move !

491
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:13,876
Hey !

492
00:40:14,854 --> 00:40:16,325
Little one !

493
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:18,785
Come back !

494
00:40:22,948 --> 00:40:25,148
Put the body in the refectory.

495
00:40:28,117 --> 00:40:30,017
How is she ?
She's doing OK.

496
00:40:30,498 --> 00:40:32,929
We've informed Monsieur le Curé.
Yes, yes, very good.

497
00:40:35,636 --> 00:40:37,436
Poor little one.

498
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:43,593
I could do nothing. Serge, Michaël and Bruno
are dead. And I don't know where Gustave is.

499
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:47,375
Why did you go on this outing without talking to me ?

500
00:40:47,598 --> 00:40:49,098
Monsieur Fournier didn't tell you ?

501
00:40:49,132 --> 00:40:51,932
I never authorised it at such a time.

502
00:40:52,356 --> 00:40:54,356
I'm only away for one day and...

503
00:40:58,381 --> 00:41:01,581
Oh ! What are we going to tell
the parents of little Larcher ?

504
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:06,710
Monsieur Fournier didn't have the right
to decide on an outing. He knew that very well.

505
00:41:07,069 --> 00:41:10,269
In addition, you're going to be
on your own in accounting for it.

506
00:41:10,526 --> 00:41:13,826
My boy ? Where's my boy ?

507
00:41:16,883 --> 00:41:20,383
Michaël. Michaël ? Where's Michaël ?

508
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:22,164
Where's Michaël ?

509
00:41:25,413 --> 00:41:28,739
Poor little one. Lucienne. How are you doing ?

510
00:41:45,305 --> 00:41:47,405
No. Leave me, No. leave me !

511
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,250
Geneviève, be dignified !

512
00:42:02,926 --> 00:42:05,144
Get up my child.

513
00:42:07,457 --> 00:42:09,212
Get up.

514
00:42:18,925 --> 00:42:24,372
This horrible tragedy is a test God sends us.

515
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:28,030
My children, kneel.

516
00:42:28,624 --> 00:42:30,524
...and praise the Lord.

517
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,180
Kneel please.

518
00:42:37,312 --> 00:42:39,725
Our Father who art in heaven...

519
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,780
Hallowed be thy name...

520
00:42:45,074 --> 00:42:46,644
Thy kingdom come...

521
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,580
Thy will be done...

522
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:59,983
Thy will be done....
On Earth as it is in Heaven...

523
00:43:03,341 --> 00:43:05,546
Give us this day...Our daily bread...

524
00:43:09,785 --> 00:43:11,603
Forgive us our trespasses...

525
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,940
As we forgive them...that trespass against us...

526
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:28,396
Darling, I was so scared.

527
00:43:29,553 --> 00:43:32,040
Is that the baby ? Your patient this morning ?

528
00:43:32,065 --> 00:43:35,165
Yes. I'll explain. Schwartz warned you ?

529
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:36,690
He told me he would.

530
00:43:36,691 --> 00:43:39,391
Yes. He came with injured children.
I was busy with them.

531
00:43:39,392 --> 00:43:43,392
The school class was machine-gunned by an aircraft.
There were three dead.

532
00:43:43,393 --> 00:43:45,093
Good God. Whatever were they doing on the roads ?

533
00:43:45,094 --> 00:43:46,094
I don't know !

534
00:43:50,999 --> 00:43:55,099
His mother haemorrhaged during the delivery.
I put her in the hands of the soldiers.

535
00:43:55,594 --> 00:43:58,720
We need to leave as fast as possible.
Just take absolute essentials.

536
00:43:58,745 --> 00:44:00,956
My God, how small he is !

537
00:44:01,423 --> 00:44:03,646
The Germans will blow up the railway yards.

538
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:07,244
They say we could stay several days in Geneva.
Time to see what happens.

539
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,125
But, him... ?

540
00:44:12,001 --> 00:44:15,302
We'll see. I hope his mother
comes out of it alright.

541
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,560
Shit ! I didn't give my details
and whereabouts to the Sergeant.

542
00:44:19,736 --> 00:44:21,448
What's he called ?

543
00:44:22,755 --> 00:44:25,530
His mother is Spanish. She called him "Te Quiero".

544
00:44:26,408 --> 00:44:30,052
Te Quiero, that's lovely.

545
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:41,915
You're sure it's wise to leave ?

546
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,550
Obviously we have to leave.

547
00:44:43,608 --> 00:44:45,952
But this morning you said it was OK
for him to go out, and ...

548
00:44:45,977 --> 00:44:48,577
Don't mix everything up please.
Now the Germans are here. Obviously we have to leave.

549
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:51,010
But to go where ?

550
00:44:51,011 --> 00:44:52,865
We could go to Georges', I have the keys.

551
00:44:52,913 --> 00:44:54,667
What more will we have at Charbonnières than here ?

552
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,864
At least it's on the other side of the river.
We'll be sheltered.

553
00:44:57,039 --> 00:44:59,739
If the Germans had any difficulty
crossing rivers, they wouldn't be here.

554
00:45:00,637 --> 00:45:01,988
Maman ?

555
00:45:02,883 --> 00:45:05,644
I'm hungry.
That's a good sign.

556
00:45:05,717 --> 00:45:06,948
Did you bring the chickens ?

557
00:45:06,973 --> 00:45:08,849
Perhaps we'll have time to cook one or two en-route.

558
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,849
No. They didn't have any at the farm.

559
00:45:46,809 --> 00:45:49,692
This residence is requisitioned for military operations.

560
00:45:49,877 --> 00:45:51,883
Kindly tell me where the telephone is.

561
00:45:53,735 --> 00:45:55,457
The telephone please !

562
00:45:55,918 --> 00:45:57,959
It's here Monsieur.

563
