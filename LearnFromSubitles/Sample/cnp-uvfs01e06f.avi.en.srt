1
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,211
What are you doing there ?

2
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:36,893
My letter to the Maréchal. It's for Monday.

3
00:00:37,864 --> 00:00:39,664
Do you want me to read it to you ?

4
00:00:40,846 --> 00:00:42,606
If you want.

5
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:46,780
Monsieur le Maréchal, since the Summer,
German soldiers are among us...

6
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:52,553
... and our soldiers are in Germany.
It would be damned simple

7
00:00:52,783 --> 00:00:57,081
if the German soldiers were in Germany,
and our soldiers were at home.

8
00:00:57,534 --> 00:00:59,012
Where did you find that ?

9
00:00:59,037 --> 00:01:01,137
I don't know. Isn't it any good ?

10
00:01:02,527 --> 00:01:04,427
Yes, yes.

11
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:11,617
But you must apply yourself,
it's almost unreadable.

12
00:01:11,832 --> 00:01:15,078
Your a's look o's.
I've already told you a hundred times.

13
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:17,331
And you can't write "damned simple" .

14
00:01:17,356 --> 00:01:19,642
Just say... "it would be good."

15
00:01:19,876 --> 00:01:21,013
...or something like that.

16
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,194
But it will be full of rubbings out !

17
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:25,029
Well then, recopy it.

18
00:01:25,054 --> 00:01:26,686
But I'll have less pages in my notebook.

19
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,587
Well use a sheet of paper.

20
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:39,109
It's not too early, eh!

21
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:42,505
The Germans have strengthened their controls
for November 11th. I ran into a checkpoint.

22
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,394
They searched the van thoroughly.

23
00:01:44,615 --> 00:01:46,915
Fortunate that we haven't yet slipped in the flyers.

24
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:49,621
Good day to you.

25
00:01:49,646 --> 00:01:52,713
Hello Madame, do you want me to
read you my letter to the Maréchal ?

26
00:01:52,856 --> 00:01:55,706
We don't have time Gustave.
Copy your letter and apply yourself.

27
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:00,618
Good. They dropped them off ?

28
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,049
Of course, no question. What do you take me for ?

29
00:02:02,072 --> 00:02:05,499
Suzanne, the plan assumed that nothing in your
schedule would differ from normal.

30
00:02:05,547 --> 00:02:08,904
We need an hour to insert the flyers.
That gets you to the Post Office at 9 o'clock.

31
00:02:08,964 --> 00:02:10,813
It means that people are going
to see you arrive late.

32
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:14,961
But not necessarily. There won't be
many people near the garage exit.

33
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,506
Even if someone sees me arrive at 9 o'clock
what proof is there I just came from Sayolle ?

34
00:02:20,104 --> 00:02:21,739
I could very well have arrived
at 8 o'clock, and gone out again.

35
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:22,758
Gone where ?

36
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,303
I don't know.

37
00:02:24,523 --> 00:02:25,669
To a café !

38
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,478
In this cold.

39
00:02:26,503 --> 00:02:28,703
The only café open at that time
is the Station Café...

40
00:02:28,818 --> 00:02:32,295
... the owner is a police informer.
If you say that, you'll sleep in jail.

41
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,933
No.      I arrived from Sayolle at 8 o'clock.

42
00:02:36,206 --> 00:02:38,306
I was late because of the checkpoint.

43
00:02:38,704 --> 00:02:40,987
I dropped the papers on the loading dock and...

44
00:02:41,507 --> 00:02:42,902
...I went to the cemetery

45
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:44,207
To pray at my father's grave.

46
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:45,939
I go there regularly at that time.
There's never anyone there.

47
00:02:45,988 --> 00:02:48,288
Why did you drop off the papers
before going to pray ?

48
00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:49,585
It's the rule.

49
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:52,513
We must drop the papers on the loading dock
as soon as they arrive.

50
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:54,682
The rule says it's the first item of business.

51
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:56,323
It could work.

52
00:02:56,418 --> 00:03:00,120
But if someone sees you leave the papers
at 9 o'clock and not 8, it'll show you're lying.

53
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:03,045
But no-one goes there.
It's a creepy cul-de-sac.

54
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:08,688
Who is working with you today ?

55
00:03:08,713 --> 00:03:10,621
Madame Morvandieu.

56
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,290
She never arrives before half past nine. Ever.

57
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:15,878
She comes on foot. She has problems with rheumatism

58
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,510
Hey, may I have some ?

59
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:24,527
Excuse me, of course.

60
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:33,219
Thank you.

61
00:03:39,372 --> 00:03:41,385
Listen to me, Gustave.

62
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:44,949
Today, I'm not taking you to school on the bike.

63
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,552
Right, but why ?

64
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,567
Because of work, Gustave.

65
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:51,259
I have to take this lady to work.

66
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:55,143
So you're going on foot.

67
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,515
But I don't like to walk when it's dark.

68
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,164
And it's cold.

69
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:01,957
No use discussing it, Gustave.
I can't do anything else.

70
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:06,665
And listen, if you are asked about this lady,
you don't know her. OK ?

71
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:30,786
COLD SNAP

72
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:49,002
Suzanne, stop.

73
00:05:49,518 --> 00:05:52,918
The string is too tight.
I can't slide in the flyers.

74
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:08,352
Shit. This is tighter than usual !

75
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:10,948
Probably because of the German insert
for November 11th.

76
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:12,212
Now what ?

77
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:14,471
See, we can only do about a score of them.

78
00:06:14,472 --> 00:06:16,199
Those on the outside.

79
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:18,620
We can't take such risks for 20 flyers.

80
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,145
We need to cut the strings.
But how do we re-tie the packets ?

81
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:22,995
We'll tie new knots.

82
00:06:23,094 --> 00:06:24,767
That'll be noticed...

83
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:26,698
...if the packets are not exactly as usual,

84
00:06:26,723 --> 00:06:29,022
The Police will ask why you didn't report it.

85
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:31,099
Do you have string at the sawmill ?

86
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,633
It's not far.

87
00:06:37,495 --> 00:06:39,095
You're afraid !

88
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,101
You're not ?

89
00:06:44,498 --> 00:06:45,929
Yes.

90
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:51,765
The sawmill night watchman will be gone by now.

91
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:55,856
Schwartz and the first employees
won't be there before 9 o'clock.

92
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,603
How long to get there ?

93
00:06:59,246 --> 00:07:00,291
A quarter of an hour.

94
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:04,216
That leaves us 30 minutes to slip in the flyers
10 minutes to go to the sawmill...

95
00:07:04,562 --> 00:07:08,279
20 minutes to re-tie the strings...
10 minutes to get to the Post Office. OK.

96
00:07:08,463 --> 00:07:10,063
It'll still work.

97
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:12,677
It's up to you.

98
00:07:52,048 --> 00:07:53,448
Can I get you some more coffee ?

99
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,486
No thanks, I'm finished.

100
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,413
It's cold this morning !

101
00:08:07,524 --> 00:08:10,645
I must get over to the Soup Distribution.
Are you coming with me ?

102
00:08:10,805 --> 00:08:12,805
Is it really necessary ?

103
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:14,661
You're still the Mayor's wife.

104
00:08:14,686 --> 00:08:16,857
... and the prettiest woman in Villeneuve.

105
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:22,845
Marchetti, don't you think that she's
the prettiest woman in Villeneuve ?

106
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:24,574
Ah, I can't permit myself Monsieur le Maire.

107
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:25,666
Even if it's me that's asking ?

108
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:28,382
Well, you see you're
boring him with your questions.

109
00:08:28,462 --> 00:08:30,938
While one's eating, one doesn't want
to be answering questions.

110
00:08:30,963 --> 00:08:33,955
Really ? Good! I'll get ready.

111
00:08:38,564 --> 00:08:40,676
You'll get used to it eventually.

112
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,970
I think we get used to everything.

113
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:46,359
That's true.

114
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:52,430
Docteur, old Camille's neighbour phoned.
He's worried. He hasn't been seen
since the day before yesterday.

115
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:57,208
Very good. Call the Secours National.
No leave it, I'll go by there.

116
00:08:58,227 --> 00:09:01,064
Old Camille is a bit tiring,
but I like him.

117
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:06,953
Good day, Lucienne.

118
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:08,110
Good day, Headmaster.

119
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:12,494
I asked Feldwebel Wagner to be present
at the reading of letters to the Maréchal.

120
00:09:12,706 --> 00:09:13,515
Good.

121
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,565
The Maréchal said we need to collaborate,
so let's collaborate.

122
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,733
And as the Inspection guy will be here,
it'll make a pretty good impression.

123
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:23,365
I hope my presence doesn't
disturb you too much, Mademoiselle.

124
00:09:23,474 --> 00:09:25,131
No, no. Not at all.

125
00:09:25,156 --> 00:09:27,456
My brother is a teacher in Saarbrucken.

126
00:09:27,488 --> 00:09:32,097
Herr Feldwebel, you sit there
I'll sit there...

127
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:34,865
... and Mr Foulquier,
indeed he'll sit wherever he wants.

128
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,827
Is this the Monsieur Foulquier who...

129
00:09:36,988 --> 00:09:40,705
Yes. Yes, yes. I've seen your file.

130
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:43,700
That affair was really unfortunate.
But in the end, obviously,
they pigeon-holed the thing.

131
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:45,509
Don't worry.

132
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,327
There you are.

133
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:49,852
I don't usually come on foot.

134
00:09:50,036 --> 00:09:54,136
So I've arrived early as it was cold
You did well.

135
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,673
Your Papa couldn't bring you ?

136
00:09:55,698 --> 00:09:59,751
Ah, Gustave Larcher !
You've done your letter, I hope ?

137
00:09:59,828 --> 00:10:02,928
Ah yes, Monsieur.
And even my Papa said it was fine.

138
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,748
Well, let's see it.

139
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:19,277
Excuse me. We have a problem with the
light downstairs. Do you have
the keys to the meter box ?

140
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:22,232
Certainly.
Can you show us Lucienne ?

141
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:24,474
You stay here, I'll be back.

142
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:46,528
You told me the watchman
wasn't here tonight.

143
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:08,429
It's Marcel !

144
00:11:08,695 --> 00:11:11,618
I don't know why he's come
to mess around at this hour.

145
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,720
It's cold. Warm me up.

146
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,590
He's stealing string ?

147
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:55,580
I mustn't linger.
When Laurin goes to see the kids...

148
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:57,819
He always returns early next day
for the milking.

149
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:04,542
You're...

150
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:19,353
And with Jeannine ?

151
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:20,889
Where are you with that ?

152
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:22,414
Nowhere.

153
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:25,402
It'll subside.

154
00:12:26,105 --> 00:12:29,590
L'Etat Francaise expresses itself through me...

155
00:12:29,906 --> 00:12:32,853
... assuring you of its sincere solidarity.

156
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:39,083
These blankets, and this soup which are offered
by the Sous-Préfecture and with the assistance...

157
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:42,387
...of the Food Agency
and the Secours National.

158
00:12:43,187 --> 00:12:48,492
These blankets, and this soup,
are the warmth of renewal...

159
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:52,959
...of French renewal that
we must build together.

160
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:57,701
Under the leadership of the
venerable and glorious victor of Verdun.

161
00:13:00,185 --> 00:13:02,276
Thank you.

162
00:13:06,064 --> 00:13:08,751
I think we can move on to the distribution of soup.

163
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,941
A very good speech, Monsieur le Sous-Préfet.

164
00:13:17,036 --> 00:13:18,736
Hold on there.

165
00:13:19,207 --> 00:13:21,013
The French are really just bellies.

166
00:13:21,038 --> 00:13:24,038
With the cold and the Germans taking everything,
this is quite natural.

167
00:13:24,245 --> 00:13:27,797
They're not taking everything dear Madame.
That's a myth.

168
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:32,666
It's bizarre, all the same,
not commemorating the 11th of November.

169
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:37,814
What I mean is I noticed you called him
the victor of Verdun...

170
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:40,032
... that was very good.

171
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:42,266
Monsieur le Maire.

172
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:45,487
Inspecteur Marchetti reports
that old Camille has died.

173
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:47,658
And he'll wait on you for the death certificate.

174
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:49,682
Poor old man, I liked him a lot.

175
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:52,817
It's imperative that we wait for von Ritter.

176
00:13:52,842 --> 00:13:56,300
I'll go there, after all a death certificate
isn't that complicated.

177
00:13:56,612 --> 00:13:58,195
That's not very funny, you know.

178
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,188
But I've already done others, remember.

179
00:14:01,268 --> 00:14:04,135
And it's always less boring
than Servier's speeches.

180
00:14:04,294 --> 00:14:05,769
I'll go with you.

181
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:08,388
Try to get names of people...

182
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:11,231
... people to inform of his death.

183
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:27,809
Monsieur le Maire, Monsieur le Sous-Préfet.

184
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:34,753
You must prevent any
patriotic demonstrations on November 11th.

185
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:39,174
Don't worry. When people are satisfied,
they don't think.

186
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:41,275
Why do you think we've organized this today ?

187
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:46,276
Very good. And I must also inform you
that we're going to keep guard...

188
00:14:46,277 --> 00:14:51,503
...with two sentries at the War Memorial
in the Grand-Place.

189
00:14:51,848 --> 00:14:54,525
You're afraid the dead will demonstrate ?

190
00:14:57,276 --> 00:15:02,726
You should know that my father
died on the Sambre in 1917...

191
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:09,094
... and I personally regret
that no commemoration is possible...

192
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:13,663
... but like my father, I'm a soldier
and I carry out orders.

193
00:15:18,357 --> 00:15:21,532
I thought that after Montoire,
an effort would have been made for the POWs.

194
00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:24,437
That will surely come.
The Maréchal knows what he's doing.

195
00:15:24,628 --> 00:15:27,606
But to guard the War Memorial.
No, that becomes...

196
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:31,468
Have you seen they've put
three Ls in 'eternellle' ?

197
00:15:33,804 --> 00:15:35,158
I hadn't seen that.

198
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:36,720
It's annoying.

199
00:15:37,502 --> 00:15:41,002
In any case thank you for coming
before your work starts, Madame Morvandieu.

200
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:45,527
It's mainly my rheumatism.
I'm glad the distribution has ended so early.

201
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:47,563
Suddenly I'm early.

202
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:51,671
On a day like today I don't think we'll have
many people at the Post Office.

203
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:18,414
I'm getting out here.
We can't risk being seen together.

204
00:16:18,693 --> 00:16:20,293
How's it going to go ?

205
00:16:21,094 --> 00:16:23,931
What's the worst we risk ?
I don't know.

206
00:16:26,358 --> 00:16:27,659
You don't have to do it Suzanne.

207
00:16:27,684 --> 00:16:30,084
No, of course not.
But in the end, yes. In fact right now.

208
00:16:32,102 --> 00:16:34,968
So we need to get going.
Time's against us.

209
00:16:35,643 --> 00:16:39,695
Remember, no contact for three days.
No matter what.

210
00:17:10,151 --> 00:17:12,222
Do I start now, or wait ?

211
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:15,699
Might as well wait for him.
All these missing children bother me.

212
00:17:16,643 --> 00:17:18,843
We'll tell him it's because of the cold.

213
00:17:19,492 --> 00:17:21,046
Foulquier is a creep, but he's not an idiot.

214
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:23,928
He's even capable of asking me
to send him a list of all the absentees.

215
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,562
Hey !

216
00:17:26,806 --> 00:17:30,006
You, wake up, eh !

217
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:37,484
Please, sit down. Sit down

218
00:17:38,705 --> 00:17:40,631
Headmaster.
Inspecteur.

219
00:17:42,952 --> 00:17:44,770
Mademoiselle Borderie.

220
00:17:46,216 --> 00:17:49,795
We're delighted to have you here
for this great occasion.

221
00:17:51,969 --> 00:17:54,820
Ah yes. I have something to
say to them before we start.

222
00:17:54,845 --> 00:17:56,819
Please. Go ahead.

223
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:02,296
Children, you are the future
of the French nation...

224
00:18:04,158 --> 00:18:07,906
... by writing to the Maréchal
it is to France you are writing.

225
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:13,003
The real France freed of her bad habits...

226
00:18:13,188 --> 00:18:15,688
...of the lies that did her so much harm...

227
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:19,071
...and the parasites who got rich on her back.

228
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:24,967
My dear children, the Maréchal hears you.

229
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,057
One moment. I took the liberty of inviting the
Feldwebel who lives in the school.
I'll go and get him.

230
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,112
Ah yes.

231
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:38,739
He should have avoided that
on the 11th of November, though.

232
00:18:40,963 --> 00:18:42,563
It will reduce waste.

233
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,345
It must be ready for tomorrow at 3 o'clock.
Go on.

234
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,470
Good day Marcel. Good day Hervé. Hello Marcel.

235
00:18:46,602 --> 00:18:48,202
Good day Monsieur Schwartz.

236
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:53,315
Is it a German order ?
Oh no, this is for the Parisians.

237
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,004
They're in a hurry.

238
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,598
What's more they don't want pine.
They want oak.

239
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,846
We should have sent them to look elsewhere.
I'll take care of it for now.

240
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:16,517
Hey, what were you doing here this morning ?

241
00:19:19,028 --> 00:19:20,114
This morning ?

242
00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:22,156
Yes. I arrived early, I saw you.

243
00:19:25,116 --> 00:19:27,024
I forgot my cigarettes.

244
00:19:27,949 --> 00:19:29,702
I've none stored at home.

245
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,747
That's funny because I saw you take some string.

246
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:33,955
It doesn't bother me that
you were taking string...

247
00:19:34,143 --> 00:19:36,343
... but given the time of day,
it surprised me a bit.

248
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:41,874
You mustn't have seen it properly.

249
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:43,844
I took my cigarettes.

250
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,077
You know, with all the restrictions
you should stop smoking in the morning.

251
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:50,049
Otherwise you won't last the month.

252
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:53,828
That's easier said than done.

253
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:59,145
I'll get on with the von Ritter order.

254
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:07,096
Ah... You scared me.

255
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,851
To tell the truth, you scared me too.

256
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:11,576
Daniel is busy at the Mairie,
so I'm substituting for him.

257
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:15,788
This is definitely not work for a woman.

258
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:20,055
You know, in assisting Daniel with corpses,
I've seen others.

259
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,641
The poor old man must have had a weakness.

260
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,641
He died of cold.

261
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,352
When I found him he was quite stiff.

262
00:20:35,828 --> 00:20:38,528
His window was open. Do you know why ?

263
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:43,192
He often slept with the window open,
to let his pigeon return.

264
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:46,066
He's definitely dead.

265
00:20:48,426 --> 00:20:50,526
I found this Interzonal Postcard.

266
00:20:51,305 --> 00:20:56,248
Signed Annette. There's an address in Nice.
Ah, that's good, we can inform her.

267
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:58,239
Yes.

268
00:21:05,955 --> 00:21:08,229
Will you help me ?

269
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:28,879
Hold on. Ah, thank you.

270
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,584
What time is it ?

271
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:32,513
It's for the certificate.

272
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,997
10 am.

273
00:21:34,022 --> 00:21:36,114
Actually, five minutes to, to be exact.

274
00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:50,640
It was very cold yesterday.

275
00:21:50,665 --> 00:21:52,637
You didn't think so ?
Yes.

276
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:01,106
How was the soup distribution ?

277
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:03,177
Lukewarm.

278
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,304
I wanted to tell you I'm very happy
to be in your home.

279
00:22:30,962 --> 00:22:32,960
Me too, I'm pleased you're staying with us.

280
00:22:45,008 --> 00:22:47,008
It's the newspaper.

281
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,826
11th of November 1940
OUT WITH THE GERMANS !

282
00:22:57,851 --> 00:23:00,472
True patriots who want to do something.
VIVE LA FRANCE !

283
00:23:02,755 --> 00:23:04,269
Monsieur le Maréchal,

284
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,325
I would like you to bring home
my friend's Papa for Christmas

285
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:10,260
And I would like chocolates
and sweets for Christmas Day.

286
00:23:10,285 --> 00:23:12,948
Because there no longer are any,
and it's not fair.

287
00:23:13,272 --> 00:23:14,695
That's good.

288
00:23:14,856 --> 00:23:16,456
Show me the letter.

289
00:23:18,116 --> 00:23:20,714
This is good but we can't send it
to the Maréchal.

290
00:23:20,739 --> 00:23:25,322
Why ?
Because today there are more
important things than chocolate.

291
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,430
Do you ever explain to them
a little about what France is...

292
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:34,971
Germany, Collaboration,
the National Revolution.  No ?
Never ?

293
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:38,989
Monsieur, we follow the Official Guidelines.
The Academy has sent us nothing.

294
00:23:39,014 --> 00:23:42,028
You must anticipate the Official Guidelines.

295
00:23:42,893 --> 00:23:48,056
Today's problem is not finding chocolate,
it's to reform France...

296
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:50,881
... after cleaning it up.
Do you understand that ?

297
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:55,010
Yes.
Good, go back to your place.

298
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,053
Next.

299
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:00,872
Le Dantec.

300
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,936
The Flyers couldn't have been
inserted in a couple of minutes.

301
00:24:07,055 --> 00:24:11,304
As on every night, the Sayolle depot
was unsupervised from 4 to 6.

302
00:24:11,724 --> 00:24:15,824
Or even later, which implies involvement
of the Post Office head.

303
00:24:15,952 --> 00:24:17,981
Why not at the newspaper ?

304
00:24:18,013 --> 00:24:20,813
Because there was a German
censorship guy there that evening.

305
00:24:20,838 --> 00:24:24,455
He told me everything was normal
and I think we can believe him.

306
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,079
The Germans will crucify us.

307
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:30,915
Right. Do we have the means
of finding out who did this ?

308
00:24:32,694 --> 00:24:34,865
Yes or no ?

309
00:24:38,094 --> 00:24:41,277
Hang on. We're a long way from
kids whistling in a cinema, here.

310
00:24:41,302 --> 00:24:43,984
Exactly, it's worse. These are people
directly opposed to the Maréchal.

311
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:46,005
No. Who oppose the Germans.

312
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,241
Since Montoire it's the same thing.
Come on, pull yourself together.

313
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:53,320
You mentioned the head of the Post Office ?

314
00:24:53,345 --> 00:24:54,640
Suzanne Richard.

315
00:24:54,665 --> 00:24:57,980
38 years old, seven years seniority,
married with two children.

316
00:24:58,783 --> 00:25:00,903
Communist ?
Not that we know.

317
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,633
Her husband was in the SFIO in 1936.

318
00:25:03,977 --> 00:25:06,677
Yes. And now he's a POW in a Stalag.

319
00:25:07,122 --> 00:25:08,817
I still think she's a suspect.

320
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:13,217
Monsieur le Maire, I'd be happy if this
were investigated by Inspecteur Marchetti.

321
00:25:15,101 --> 00:25:18,030
I am at your disposal.
So proceed.

322
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,468
To mount a such a coup it first
had to be conceived, then organised.

323
00:25:21,493 --> 00:25:25,105
The flyers printed, and several secret meetings.

324
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:27,692
I think we're dealing with a group.

325
00:25:27,717 --> 00:25:29,500
A Communist group.

326
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:34,318
'Germans Out !' is not really the Party Line.

327
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:38,057
Yes. But they're the only ones
to have the organisation.

328
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,594
Which brings me to a delicate point
Monsieur le Maire.

329
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:43,991
What ?

330
00:25:44,016 --> 00:25:46,816
Your brother was fingered as
a Communist in 1936 ?

331
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:50,421
In 1936. Only in 36 !

332
00:25:50,907 --> 00:25:55,807
But I've every reason to believe that last January
he formed a Party cell in the Schwartz sawmill.

333
00:25:56,546 --> 00:25:59,561
You're not, however, going to
investigate my brother ?

334
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:04,719
Listen, Larcher. When it was Bellini,
we went after his son...

335
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,258
Marchetti's right. It's in showing that Order rules
without exception, that we'll carry people with us.

336
00:26:13,717 --> 00:26:16,017
I think we need to start with the Postmistress.

337
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:18,642
She was seen arriving at 9am
which indicates a large delay.

338
00:26:20,793 --> 00:26:24,693
And if this lead doesn't pan out,
I'll venture to call in your brother.

339
00:26:25,473 --> 00:26:27,020
Just to see.

340
00:26:28,846 --> 00:26:31,046
The youngest, Gustave Larcher.

341
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,671
Is Larcher the Mayor's son ?

342
00:26:34,696 --> 00:26:36,492
His nephew.

343
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,259
It will perhaps be good to select his letter.

344
00:26:39,304 --> 00:26:41,704
Let's wait and see what's in it.

345
00:26:42,466 --> 00:26:44,363
We're listening.

346
00:26:44,998 --> 00:26:51,429
Monsieur le Maréchal.
Since the Summer, German soldiers are with us
and our soldiers are in Germany.

347
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:54,098
It would, however...

348
00:26:55,431 --> 00:27:00,694
...be even better if the
German soldiers were in Germany,
and our soldiers were here at home....

349
00:27:02,297 --> 00:27:04,866
Good. This is very good.
Really !

350
00:27:05,575 --> 00:27:06,519
Let me see your letter.

351
00:27:06,544 --> 00:27:08,335
Wait!

352
00:27:13,736 --> 00:27:15,935
This is not good at all !

353
00:27:16,064 --> 00:27:18,387
Not good at all.

354
00:27:21,894 --> 00:27:24,594
The German soldiers are very happy to be in France.

355
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,029
Bad propaganda.

356
00:27:29,054 --> 00:27:32,977
Yes, yes. Indeed, it's not good.

357
00:27:33,421 --> 00:27:35,868
This is not good at all.

358
00:27:36,074 --> 00:27:38,561
This is really not a good idea.

359
00:27:38,841 --> 00:27:42,224
So you, I don't know...I don't really know
what's going through your head.

360
00:27:42,323 --> 00:27:45,073
Back to your place, you bad boy.

361
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:47,526
These Boches !

362
00:27:50,411 --> 00:27:52,984
It was slipped in the paper this morning.

363
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:58,376
What is this thing ?

364
00:27:58,401 --> 00:28:00,901
You've broken off with the Postmistress ?

365
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,592
Obviously, why ?

366
00:28:02,626 --> 00:28:03,587
Is she involved ?

367
00:28:03,612 --> 00:28:05,412
Well, the cops think she is.

368
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:07,918
How do you know ?

369
00:28:07,943 --> 00:28:09,548
You ask too many questions, Comrade.

370
00:28:09,573 --> 00:28:10,632
We know, that's all.

371
00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:14,210
She arrived late for work.
She'll be arrested soon, for sure.

372
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:17,563
Listen, the Comrades are worried about
your past relationship with her.

373
00:28:17,588 --> 00:28:20,501
The Party can't be involved in a provocation.

374
00:28:20,936 --> 00:28:24,536
'Germans Out !'
How can they think the Party is involved.

375
00:28:25,576 --> 00:28:27,352
It doesn't make sense.

376
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:32,576
Hey, Max, can you move your truck ?

377
00:28:47,617 --> 00:28:48,738
What's this ?

378
00:28:48,763 --> 00:28:50,738
I don't know.

379
00:28:52,068 --> 00:28:54,863
It's a letter from your father.
You don't recognize his handwriting ?

380
00:28:54,922 --> 00:28:55,563
What does he say ?

381
00:28:55,588 --> 00:28:57,808
You know what he says.

382
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:00,834
He asks me to get rid of Marie and Laurin.

383
00:29:00,894 --> 00:29:03,098
Listen, he's the owner.

384
00:29:05,124 --> 00:29:07,904
And you really think your father
should arrange our affairs ?

385
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:10,029
Since you won't do anything about it...

386
00:29:10,172 --> 00:29:11,572
You're hurting me.

387
00:29:12,476 --> 00:29:17,476
It's a simple fad. A moment of madness
that she surely regrets as much as me.

388
00:29:17,955 --> 00:29:21,471
I want you to get rid of that slut.

389
00:29:22,008 --> 00:29:24,827
Nobody can force me to do
something I don't want to do.

390
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,904
Do you know that ?

391
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:44,741
Do you know why you're here, Madame Richard ?

392
00:30:46,082 --> 00:30:48,641
I guess it's over this stupid story of the leaflets.

393
00:30:49,626 --> 00:30:52,126
Why stupid ? These are very good leaflets.

394
00:30:52,693 --> 00:30:55,822
And between us, we'd all like
the Germans to leave.

395
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,033
What time did you arrive at work this morning ?

396
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:01,101
About 8 o'clock, as every morning.

397
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:02,759
Shortly before ? Shortly after ?

398
00:31:02,784 --> 00:31:04,258
I'm sorry. I have to be precise.

399
00:31:04,306 --> 00:31:07,285
I seem to have heard the
church bell just after, but...

400
00:31:07,286 --> 00:31:08,816
.. I'm not sure.

401
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,918
So you arrived at 8am and dropped
the papers on the dock. Is that correct ?

402
00:31:13,086 --> 00:31:14,380
Well yes.

403
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:17,733
And you didn't see anything special ?

404
00:31:18,758 --> 00:31:21,701
No. You know, a bundle of papers,
is a bundle of papers.

405
00:31:21,808 --> 00:31:23,278
That's right.

406
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,717
And you're sure it was really 8 o'clock ?

407
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:27,869
Yes.

408
00:31:28,566 --> 00:31:30,915
And between 8 and 9, what did you do ?

409
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,255
I went to pray at my father's grave.

410
00:31:33,472 --> 00:31:35,172
An hour of prayer ?

411
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:38,097
Well you know, plus the time to return...

412
00:31:38,098 --> 00:31:39,498
... smoke a little cigarette...

413
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:42,275
This is great. So we'll certainly
find the butt, then.

414
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:49,035
In fact, no. I didn't actually smoke today,
now that I recall...

415
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:52,251
Since the cold wave I've had a sore throat.

416
00:31:52,365 --> 00:31:55,986
And besides, I shared my last cigarette
with Madame Morvandieu yesterday.

417
00:31:56,201 --> 00:31:58,412
Who saw you arrive at 9 o'clock.

418
00:31:59,018 --> 00:31:59,743
Pardon ?

419
00:31:59,768 --> 00:32:02,557
Yes. Because Madame Morvandieu
arrived early this morning.

420
00:32:02,732 --> 00:32:04,838
She distributed the soup at the Mairie, and...

421
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:07,620
...she saw you unload papers at 9 o'clock.

422
00:32:07,755 --> 00:32:09,456
... not 8 o'clock.

423
00:32:10,857 --> 00:32:14,342
We're sure of the time because it was
Monsieur le Maire himself who saw her leave.

424
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:20,921
Yes. It was her then.
I believe I saw her.

425
00:32:21,756 --> 00:32:24,554
So you acknowledge that you dropped off
the papers at 9 o'clock ?

426
00:32:26,294 --> 00:32:27,424
Yes.

427
00:32:27,449 --> 00:32:30,549
And you acknowledge that you
participated in this little action ?

428
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,522
Not at all, I had nothing to do with it.

429
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:37,922
Why did you lie about your arrival time, then ?

430
00:32:37,947 --> 00:32:39,645
Because of the Regulations.

431
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:43,307
The Regulations require us to drop off
the papers before any other business.

432
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:48,928
So today, as I knew no-one would arrive
before half past nine, I said...

433
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,211
...I'll go and pray first, and drop them at 9.

434
00:32:54,914 --> 00:32:57,964
You won't talk to the Regional Office ?

435
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:01,577
Because with a story like that
I risk a penalty.

436
00:33:18,142 --> 00:33:19,558
So ?

437
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,964
She's involved. I've put her in a cell.

438
00:33:22,154 --> 00:33:27,581
She confessed ?
No. Remarkably she agreed with
the testimony of Madame Morvandieu.

439
00:33:27,824 --> 00:33:30,002
So far, I have nothing.

440
00:33:33,431 --> 00:33:36,831
But behind the facade, I sense fear.

441
00:33:39,537 --> 00:33:41,338
Yes, I feel her fear.

442
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,380
I didn't understand what got into Fritz,
It was a very good letter.

443
00:33:46,031 --> 00:33:49,011
I'm on the verge of asking for an
explanation from the Kommandantur.

444
00:33:49,036 --> 00:33:51,941
That he didn't like the letter. Fine !
But to burn it !

445
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:54,131
The Germans are unpredictable.

446
00:33:54,163 --> 00:33:56,380
That may be why they've won the war.

447
00:33:57,379 --> 00:33:59,350
I'll go and watch the children's break.

448
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:01,539
You're right.

449
00:34:01,835 --> 00:34:03,921
See you soon, Lucienne.

450
00:34:26,663 --> 00:34:28,915
Thank you.

451
00:34:42,754 --> 00:34:48,082
I don't know her political views.
You think we discuss politics at the moment ?

452
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:51,735
When she unloaded the papers,
did you see anyone with her ?

453
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:53,461
No !

454
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,995
Do you know if she has the habit
of praying in the graveyard ?

455
00:34:56,058 --> 00:34:58,119
Yes. At her father's grave.

456
00:34:58,213 --> 00:35:00,111
Almost every morning.

457
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:04,622
She did nothing strange in recent weeks ?

458
00:35:04,794 --> 00:35:07,594
I don't know. What does that mean. Strange ?

459
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:09,840
Something unusual.

460
00:35:11,262 --> 00:35:13,718
Madame Morvandieu, if you hide something from us,
whatever it is.

461
00:35:13,743 --> 00:35:15,534
You'll be complicit in
something very serious.

462
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:17,206
Do you understand that ?

463
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,741
I don't want to harm her reputation.
She's such a good woman...

464
00:35:22,785 --> 00:35:25,198
...and with her husband in a Stalag...

465
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:32,101
...but there were days, during the lunch break,
when I saw her talking with a man.

466
00:35:32,554 --> 00:35:34,503
They seemed to know each other well.

467
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,642
Oh, they did nothing wrong...

468
00:35:36,748 --> 00:35:38,768
... but they seemed to know each other.

469
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:40,437
Who was it ?

470
00:35:40,716 --> 00:35:45,016
That's what surprised me, it was
the Mayor's brother, Marcel Larcher.

471
00:35:45,041 --> 00:35:47,017
The guy at the sawmill.

472
00:35:47,452 --> 00:35:49,637
I had no idea that she knew him.

473
00:35:52,886 --> 00:35:54,860
I don't want them to be persecuted.

474
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,307
Laurin is a good man
and times are too difficult.

475
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,912
But I'll never see her again. I swear.

476
00:36:01,937 --> 00:36:03,737
I swear our on our love.

477
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,872
Swear on Marceau's head.

478
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,047
I swear on Marceau's head.

479
00:36:10,129 --> 00:36:12,229
Madame.
What is it ?

480
00:36:12,365 --> 00:36:13,765
Is Monsieur with you ?

481
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:15,966
Can't she look after it.

482
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:16,967
Yes.

483
00:36:16,968 --> 00:36:20,568
Monsieur, there's a policeman for you,
Inspector Marchetti. He says it's urgent.

484
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:23,240
Tell him to wait.

485
00:36:25,365 --> 00:36:27,207
What's he want from me ?

486
00:36:37,223 --> 00:36:38,981
Inspecteur ?

487
00:36:39,558 --> 00:36:41,393
Monsieur Schwartz.

488
00:36:44,134 --> 00:36:45,065
Did you see this ?

489
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:47,167
Yes. I'm a subscriber.

490
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:50,442
You remember, when I arrived in June.
I was on the trail of a Communist cell.

491
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:52,969
Yes, vaguely. You know, during all that mess...

492
00:36:54,886 --> 00:36:57,088
Yes. I established that they
printed their leaflets at your place...

493
00:36:57,113 --> 00:36:59,409
Ah yes, yes.

494
00:36:59,995 --> 00:37:01,995
So ?

495
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,336
Do you still have your printing machine ?

496
00:37:06,361 --> 00:37:08,561
You know, during the exodus,
the sawmill was looted twice...

497
00:37:08,928 --> 00:37:10,528
...they took everything...

498
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,230
...including the printing machine.

499
00:37:12,255 --> 00:37:14,335
Funny booty for a looter, right ?

500
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:21,445
Germans Out!
Why would I have anything to do with that ?

501
00:37:21,643 --> 00:37:23,905
I don't want to lose
the only customers I have left.

502
00:37:30,017 --> 00:37:33,672
Tell me, the brother of the Mayor, Marcel Larcher...

503
00:37:34,542 --> 00:37:36,242
Yes. Well ?

504
00:37:36,664 --> 00:37:39,064
Do you think he's still a Communist ?

505
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:41,908
I know nothing about it. Do you think
if he was a Communist, he'd tell me ?

506
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:46,990
Monsieur Schwartz, you already lied to me
four days ago about your employee, Sarah.

507
00:37:47,268 --> 00:37:50,689
I passed on that because it was a trifle,
but today the case is much more serious.

508
00:37:53,274 --> 00:37:56,039
Let me ask you a clear and precise question.

509
00:37:56,064 --> 00:37:59,864
Do you know if Marcel Larcher's activities
have been a little different lately ?

510
00:38:00,806 --> 00:38:03,018
Something out of the ordinary.

511
00:38:04,465 --> 00:38:06,665
No. I've not seen anything.

512
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:10,991
You know, Mr. Larcher is a work-horse.
He says nothing, he does his work.

513
00:38:11,446 --> 00:38:13,412
I've seen nothing.

514
00:38:14,207 --> 00:38:16,031
Please.

515
00:38:20,399 --> 00:38:21,999
Very well. Thank you.

516
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:44,998
The noose is tightening, Marcel.

517
00:38:45,327 --> 00:38:46,512
I don't know what you're talking about.

518
00:38:46,537 --> 00:38:48,734
Stop taking me for an mug.

519
00:38:55,363 --> 00:38:57,625
The police just left my house.
They're coming back here.

520
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,862
So obviously they suspect you.
I covered for you this morning.

521
00:39:01,044 --> 00:39:03,040
But if you used string from here
for the bundles of papers...

522
00:39:03,065 --> 00:39:05,214
... they'll realize it's
not at all the same string.

523
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,730
You're really irresponsible.

524
00:39:13,674 --> 00:39:15,874
Thanks for warning me.

525
00:39:33,694 --> 00:39:36,494
I finished typing the Directive on Hunting.

526
00:39:38,272 --> 00:39:39,772
How are you ?

527
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:42,930
Marchetti is putting me on the spot following a...

528
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:46,232
Ah well, perhaps it's not too bad.

529
00:39:46,257 --> 00:39:48,174
You'd have preferred to investigate it ?
Yes.

530
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:50,499
Oh good ! Come on.

531
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:58,737
If it was me in charge of the investigation,
there'd be no risk of finding culprit.

532
00:39:58,926 --> 00:40:00,326
But Marchetti will find them.

533
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:02,416
I didn't understand that.

534
00:40:02,493 --> 00:40:08,093
I'm a fool. I should never have made my
disapproval of Montoire and Collaboration plain.

535
00:40:08,118 --> 00:40:10,918
It's not you who's a fool.
You're a sincere man.

536
00:40:10,919 --> 00:40:12,719
Well nowadays that's the same thing.

537
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:15,754
I'm not going to be able to do
anything for this crackpot !

538
00:40:15,779 --> 00:40:17,909
I think you're very hard on them

539
00:40:18,135 --> 00:40:21,531
They're amateurs, they've no chance.

540
00:40:29,617 --> 00:40:31,417
Monsieur Larcher ?

541
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:35,924
Come Gustave.
Monsieur Larcher ! You can't come into a class.

542
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:37,852
Have you spoken to Mr Bériot ?
Gustave, please.

543
00:40:37,877 --> 00:40:38,877
Hurry up.

544
00:40:38,902 --> 00:40:42,748
Don't move.
I can't let you take him like this.
It's contrary to all regulations.

545
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,931
Screw the rules.

546
00:40:48,376 --> 00:40:50,181
Mr Bériot ?

547
00:40:50,206 --> 00:40:51,406
Mr Bériot !

548
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:53,354
Mr Bériot.

549
00:40:56,703 --> 00:40:58,391
What is it Papa ?

550
00:40:58,416 --> 00:41:00,767
Where's your bike ?

551
00:41:02,017 --> 00:41:04,534
Papa, what is it ?

552
00:41:10,338 --> 00:41:13,038
I have to go on a trip, Gustave. For a long time.

553
00:41:13,063 --> 00:41:14,463
We're leaving ?

554
00:41:14,673 --> 00:41:16,736
No. Not we. Me.

555
00:41:17,044 --> 00:41:19,453
But what about me ? Where am I going ?

556
00:41:20,088 --> 00:41:22,319
To Uncle Daniel's.

557
00:41:22,957 --> 00:41:25,767
I don't want to go
and live with Uncle Daniel.

558
00:41:25,792 --> 00:41:27,892
I'm not asking for your opinion, Gustave.

559
00:41:30,813 --> 00:41:33,615
Listen. I have something important
to tell you. And there's not much time.

560
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,677
The lady this morning. You don't know her.

561
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:38,109
Nobody came this morning, you hear me ?

562
00:41:40,292 --> 00:41:43,592
But you'll come to see me at Uncle Daniel's ?

563
00:41:50,098 --> 00:41:51,685
Don't tell me you're involved in this !

564
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:53,610
I didn't tell you.

565
00:41:54,185 --> 00:41:56,415
Can you look after the kid, yes or no ?

566
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,625
You know very well it's yes.
Otherwise you wouldn't have brought him.

567
00:42:00,923 --> 00:42:04,050
Marcel, do you realize that I'll
have to report your visit to the police ?

568
00:42:04,051 --> 00:42:05,651
Do what you want.

569
00:42:05,676 --> 00:42:07,560
That's really you, that is !

570
00:42:07,729 --> 00:42:11,529
I just ask you to do what you have to
and you give me a morality lesson !

571
00:42:12,188 --> 00:42:14,488
It's always been like that.

572
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:17,007
What are you going to do now ?

573
00:42:17,032 --> 00:42:19,032
It's hard to answer you.
Why ?

574
00:42:19,057 --> 00:42:21,322
You'll have to tell the police.

575
00:42:21,578 --> 00:42:23,512
You are intolerable.

576
00:42:23,732 --> 00:42:26,929
I'd like to point out that the officer
in charge of this case, lives here.

577
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,184
You're lucky he wasn't here.

578
00:42:28,209 --> 00:42:31,534
It's not luck. I know he's currently
snooping around the sawmill.

579
00:42:31,612 --> 00:42:34,965
So if you have to report, then report me.
Just give me 2 or 3 hours.

580
00:42:40,252 --> 00:42:42,155
Here. This is a letter for the little one...

581
00:42:42,213 --> 00:42:44,467
...if something goes wrong.

582
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,466
You're going to stay a little while with Uncle.

583
00:43:01,632 --> 00:43:03,651
Remember what I told you ?

584
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:25,760
I'll show you where you're going to sleep.

585
00:43:25,785 --> 00:43:27,550
Come.       Come on.

586
00:44:46,185 --> 00:44:48,440
The bag ?

587
00:45:07,551 --> 00:45:10,351
It's nice to have spared us a long search.

588
00:45:10,376 --> 00:45:12,242
Thank you.

589
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:23,108
You continue to deny you know this man ?

590
00:45:24,512 --> 00:45:26,325
It's not my fault if he says he knows me.

591
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:29,750
We have a very reliable witness who
saw you together a few days ago.

592
00:45:30,295 --> 00:45:32,063
Well, he's wrong.

593
00:45:35,722 --> 00:45:37,722
Tell me, Madame Richard.

594
00:45:37,755 --> 00:45:39,955
Who's going to feed your children tonight ?

595
00:45:43,455 --> 00:45:45,755
Because you're keeping me here ?

596
00:45:50,901 --> 00:45:53,122
Bring in Larcher, please.

597
00:46:17,245 --> 00:46:21,621
Here are the pieces of string which tied up
the bundles of newspapers, Madame Richard.

598
00:46:22,213 --> 00:46:25,702
It appears they come from the
sawmill where Monsieur Larcher works.

599
00:46:25,927 --> 00:46:27,833
Can you explain that too ?

600
00:46:33,269 --> 00:46:36,369
She can't tell you anything.
She's not aware of anything.

601
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:39,639
I'm sorry, love.

602
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:45,863
I made this woman my mistress so
I could do this action with the Post.

603
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,908
I used our meetings to advance my plan.

604
00:46:50,144 --> 00:46:52,019
And this morning afterwards...

605
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:56,513
I used the opportunity of her being
asleep in the van, to insert the flyers.

606
00:46:56,538 --> 00:46:59,121
I re-tied the bundles with the sawmill twine.

607
00:47:00,723 --> 00:47:02,901
I didn't think anyone would see the difference.

608
00:47:02,926 --> 00:47:04,526
Well, that's it.

609
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:07,730
That explains why the
witness saw them together.

610
00:47:07,865 --> 00:47:11,506
We were thinking of politics
and it was adultery.

611
00:47:13,979 --> 00:47:16,279
How long have you been meeting ?

612
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,600
A few weeks.

613
00:47:22,153 --> 00:47:25,753
Listen, do with me what you want,
but don't dirty her reputation.

614
00:47:25,936 --> 00:47:29,912
A POW's wife, adultery, this is serious.

615
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:35,215
That could upset the Judge on the case, Monsieur.

616
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,673
Forgive me Suzanne.

617
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:45,757
Where did you go for your little meetings ?

618
00:47:49,593 --> 00:47:51,493
Near the cemetery.

619
00:47:51,518 --> 00:47:53,418
In the mornings.

620
00:47:53,443 --> 00:47:55,474
Well, that's nice.

621
00:47:56,466 --> 00:47:59,381
Good. We'll remand both of you...

622
00:47:59,453 --> 00:48:01,980
...and the judge will do whatever he wishes.

623
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:14,322
Eat your soup while it's hot, Gustave.

624
00:48:14,991 --> 00:48:16,872
Thank you, Maria.

625
00:48:23,459 --> 00:48:25,159
Thank you.

626
00:48:37,685 --> 00:48:40,471
Your brother will be transferred to...
Not in front of the little one.

627
00:48:40,861 --> 00:48:43,061
Is your soup good, Gustave ?

628
00:48:43,371 --> 00:48:44,759
Yes.

629
00:48:45,244 --> 00:48:47,147
When will Papa come back ?

630
00:48:47,207 --> 00:48:49,127
We don't know yet, darling.

631
00:48:49,994 --> 00:48:52,094
You never called me darling before.

632
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:59,572
I'm really sorry for this situation, but the
charges against your brother are overwhelming.

633
00:49:00,686 --> 00:49:02,708
He confessed, anyway.

634
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:05,239
Do you know what he risks ?

635
00:49:06,057 --> 00:49:08,903
Well first, administrative detention...

636
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:11,468
.. under the law of 1939, and then...

637
00:49:12,515 --> 00:49:14,241
After that, I don't know.

638
00:49:15,004 --> 00:49:16,604
Six months or a year.

639
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:21,696
And the Postmistress ?

640
00:49:23,314 --> 00:49:25,475
The judge swallowed the story of adultery.

641
00:49:25,823 --> 00:49:29,288
He told me he was going to give her
a little lecture, but not prosecute her.

642
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,447
You want more soup, darling ?

643
00:49:38,472 --> 00:49:40,535
But, I haven't finished.

644
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:42,975
Ah yes. You're right.

645
00:49:43,496 --> 00:49:46,396
So if you want me to move out...

646
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:55,816
No.

647
00:49:55,912 --> 00:49:57,752
Not at all.
