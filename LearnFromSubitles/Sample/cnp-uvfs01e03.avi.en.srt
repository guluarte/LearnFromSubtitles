1
00:00:00,609 --> 00:00:03,444
CROSSING THE LINE

2
00:00:06,896 --> 00:00:07,896
Marcel ?

3
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:10,181
Oh, there you are. We've got problems
with the main circular saw.

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,890
Any news of Meyer ?

5
00:00:12,074 --> 00:00:13,374
Meyers' in the Stalag.

6
00:00:13,534 --> 00:00:15,358
His wife got a letter this morning.

7
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:17,697
That's the day shot. Ah well, too bad, call Berthier.

8
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:19,194
It'll be expensive, but too bad.

9
00:00:19,724 --> 00:00:23,224
Inès, remember to call Berthier,
we've a problem with the saw again.

10
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:26,608
Very good, Monsieur Schwartz.

11
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:33,714
Monsieur Schwartz ?

12
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:35,341
Kommandant.

13
00:00:35,382 --> 00:00:37,645
You make planks here, don't you ?

14
00:00:37,858 --> 00:00:39,858
Yes, planks and everything made of wood.

15
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:43,053
I need planks and lots of beams.

16
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:47,909
For the extension of the barracks....the old boys school.

17
00:00:48,124 --> 00:00:50,724
It's a rush job. Can you do it ?

18
00:00:51,154 --> 00:00:53,857
I need the details of the order.
We've just had a problem with the saw...

19
00:00:53,882 --> 00:00:56,682
A motorcyclist will bring you a file during the day.

20
00:00:58,341 --> 00:01:00,812
I need a quick answer.

21
00:01:01,171 --> 00:01:05,853
Obviously, this work will be paid for
in marks not francs.

22
00:01:06,256 --> 00:01:07,656
Monsieur...

23
00:01:30,863 --> 00:01:33,163
What do you think of it ?

24
00:01:33,522 --> 00:01:35,143
You're the boss.

25
00:01:36,232 --> 00:01:37,857
We can do it.

26
00:01:39,954 --> 00:01:41,595
We'll need to find guys.

27
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:43,831
And there's the problem of delivery.

28
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:49,346
I suppose if we're working for the
Germans they'll cough up the petrol.

29
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:52,480
That's not a bad scam.

30
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:56,763
The foresters' delivery wagon. I'll get on it.

31
00:02:58,518 --> 00:02:59,992
Look.

32
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:01,746
So, Te Quiero ?

33
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,181
You're giving Papa a little smile ?

34
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:08,592
He only smiles for Maman.
Are you coming to Papa ?

35
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:11,143
Here !

36
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,044
The bottle.

37
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:20,912
Commissaire de Kerven has asked a favour.
He has a problem lodging Inspecteur Marchetti.

38
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,305
You know, the young cop that helped us at the Church.

39
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:24,116
So ?

40
00:03:24,141 --> 00:03:27,108
Well, I accepted him staying here, we've room.

41
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:30,098
You could have asked me first !

42
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:31,323
It's a bother ?

43
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:33,036
No, no.

44
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:42,339
You can leave it, Maria.

45
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:47,521
Monsieur le Maire, a German military
telephone cable was sabotaged last night...

46
00:03:47,546 --> 00:03:51,483
... in the central square, just in front
of the school. It's intolerable.

47
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,186
I am sorry Kommandant.

48
00:03:53,211 --> 00:03:55,194
You're not playing the game.

49
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:59,878
When I think of you pestering me with stories
of parcels for your POWs !

50
00:03:59,903 --> 00:04:01,403
It happened last night ?

51
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:02,909
Just in front of the school.

52
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:05,382
There'll be an investigation by our Police.

53
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:07,161
Are you sure this is sabotage ?

54
00:04:07,186 --> 00:04:16,015
Monsieur le Maire, be informed, that from today
until further notice, the curfew starts at 18:00h.

55
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,305
I won't have the time to warn people.

56
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:23,856
Henceforth you will establish a list
of the names, of 20 heads of family.

57
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:29,900
And personally bring this list to me
at the Kommandantur by tonight.

58
00:04:30,877 --> 00:04:31,949
Otherwise... !

59
00:04:32,457 --> 00:04:37,257
I haven't had the opportunity
to congratulate you on your nomination.

60
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,832
Cutting a German cable ! Who could
have done this stupidity ?

61
00:04:47,095 --> 00:04:49,695
It's this list of 20 names that worries me.

62
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,867
You believe he wants to take hostages
for a thing like that ?

63
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:55,492
They're not going to take hostages
for a so-called cut cable.

64
00:04:56,442 --> 00:04:59,242
If it hadn't been cut they wouldn't
be coming to crap all over us.

65
00:05:01,378 --> 00:05:04,305
No. Above all the question is what to do.

66
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:06,519
I don't follow you clearly Monsieur le Sous-Préfet.

67
00:05:06,863 --> 00:05:10,263
We could fix matters, if we arrest
the jerk who did this.

68
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:13,425
It's not for us to do the Boches' work !

69
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:15,866
Excuse me Commissaire, you didn't
exactly shine in June.

70
00:05:15,891 --> 00:05:19,691
I don't think you're well placed
to give us moral lessons.

71
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,502
I had a moment of weakness. It happens.

72
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:23,727
Not when one is in charge of public order.

73
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:25,537
Messieurs !

74
00:05:28,187 --> 00:05:31,100
Is it certain this would solve the blockage of POW parcels ?

75
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:36,184
Monsieur le Maire, if we start to do police work
to obtain something from the Boches, we're done for.

76
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,090
They'll end up asking us for anything they please.

77
00:05:38,156 --> 00:05:40,356
Commissaire, he's asked for a list
for heaven's sake !

78
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:43,499
It's essential for rounding up hostages.

79
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:47,217
If something can be done to avoid it,
it must be done.

80
00:05:49,003 --> 00:05:52,692
I'm not asking the impossible, but see
what you can get from your informers...

81
00:05:52,717 --> 00:05:54,717
... in that neighbourhood, you never know.

82
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:57,032
Excuse me, I have to go.

83
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:59,395
A marriage and then a birth.

84
00:06:00,847 --> 00:06:03,296
If we find the culprit, are you going
to hand him over to the Boches ?

85
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,288
Of course not !

86
00:06:06,154 --> 00:06:10,416
If you find him, we'll brag to the Germans...

87
00:06:10,441 --> 00:06:13,440
...and bring him before a French Court.
That way we win on all counts.

88
00:06:14,182 --> 00:06:16,862
Don't miss this opportunity
to redeem yourself de Kervern.

89
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:17,992
I don't understand.

90
00:06:18,017 --> 00:06:20,017
I'm supporting ten families here
and I have no priority !

91
00:06:20,341 --> 00:06:21,738
I'm sorry, I really can't do anything for you.

92
00:06:21,763 --> 00:06:23,677
Four soldier's death notices today.

93
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:26,210
If you really want to inform the families.

94
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:28,985
How are the interim arrangements going ?
Are they taking shape ?

95
00:06:29,074 --> 00:06:31,285
As you can see, we're coping.

96
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:32,322
Good luck !

97
00:06:33,015 --> 00:06:34,916
Good day Monsieur le Maire.

98
00:06:34,892 --> 00:06:36,792
I have a real problem with petrol.

99
00:06:36,793 --> 00:06:38,428
Ah, no, I've nothing to do with petrol.

100
00:06:38,632 --> 00:06:40,373
The Germans control absolutely everything.

101
00:06:40,607 --> 00:06:42,807
How am I going to run the sawmill without petrol ?

102
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:52,872
I'm sorry, I don't have good news.
I have a letter for the wife of your tenant, Lorrain Germain.

103
00:06:52,897 --> 00:06:55,646
It's a form letter. They took their time !

104
00:06:57,733 --> 00:06:59,721
Poor Marie !

105
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:02,132
It makes me sad. She's a good woman.

106
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:05,136
I'm going to inform her right now.

107
00:07:22,113 --> 00:07:24,113
Why's he smiling at us like that ?

108
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,486
Because we're cops. The Germans love order.
Ah yes.

109
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:32,147
Sabotage as tourism, right ?

110
00:07:33,064 --> 00:07:34,100
Yes.

111
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,925
The guy had to have pulled the cable from below.

112
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,950
You've seen the anchors...it needed a hell of a force.

113
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:40,072
Surely there were several of them.

114
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:41,532
Anyway !

115
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:45,328
To come into the courtyard of the school
during full curfew, with the sentries around....

116
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,793
So ?
It suggests a concerted plan, a real organisation.

117
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:52,117
I don't see who could do something like this so quickly.

118
00:07:54,864 --> 00:07:56,463
Perhaps really the Communists.

119
00:07:57,147 --> 00:07:59,366
That's your obsession, eh, the Communists ?

120
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:02,783
No. But I know they have the means and people.

121
00:08:02,991 --> 00:08:06,507
For now the Communists go along with the Boches.
Why would they sabotage one of their cables ?

122
00:08:06,532 --> 00:08:09,354
I know the Communists well, they only work for themselves !

123
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,545
And then I might track down Marcel Larcher.

124
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,870
The guy at the sawmill.

125
00:08:13,287 --> 00:08:15,204
In 1936 he was fingered as a Communist.

126
00:08:16,153 --> 00:08:18,772
And there  were the leaflets in June. Remember ?

127
00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:19,897
Yes.

128
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:22,717
Marcel Larcher's also the Mayor's brother.

129
00:08:24,718 --> 00:08:27,368
When are you moving in with him ?

130
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:28,935
Right away.

131
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:32,387
OK. For now we can put the Communists on one side.

132
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:34,026
I'm going to trawl through the school.

133
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:39,067
As soon as you've moved in, scout around.
See if anyone saw or heard anything last night.

134
00:08:45,077 --> 00:08:47,190
Tomorrow, possible. Today, not possible !

135
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,316
Not valid. Not possible to cross the demarcation Line.

136
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:58,941
But how can it not be valid. Look at it
before saying it's not valid.

137
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:01,191
Not valid. Make a U-turn.

138
00:09:01,216 --> 00:09:03,326
Listen, I'm sorry, this document is valid.

139
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:06,067
Look 15th of October. This is the 30th of September.

140
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,746
Today, problem. Make a U-turn.

141
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:23,258
Bettine ?... May I ?

142
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:26,131
Good day Monsieur Schwartz.

143
00:09:25,158 --> 00:09:28,382
Good day. Do you know Marie Germain
in Les Essarts?

144
00:09:28,682 --> 00:09:29,469
Sort of.

145
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:32,336
Do me a great favour. Go and ask her to meet me here.

146
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:35,160
Tell her its urgent.
Good, OK.

147
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:37,223
Good of you. Thank you.

148
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,734
Very urgent, eh.

149
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,113
What is it ?

150
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:04,138
Its the list Von Ritter demanded.

151
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:08,467
Twenty men's names.

152
00:10:08,722 --> 00:10:10,922
You put yourself down ?

153
00:10:12,122 --> 00:10:15,286
Darling, as First Magistrate of the Commune,
I must be first on the list.

154
00:10:15,311 --> 00:10:16,786
You haven't included your brother !

155
00:10:18,348 --> 00:10:20,313
Yes, I was able to spare him that !

156
00:10:21,062 --> 00:10:22,510
You know Micheline is very sick.

157
00:10:22,657 --> 00:10:24,444
He'll resent being kept off.

158
00:10:25,464 --> 00:10:27,563
He wants me on it anyway.

159
00:10:33,904 --> 00:10:36,790
What will happen to the men on this list ?

160
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:54,290
Good day Marek, you know about the cable ?

161
00:10:55,943 --> 00:11:01,043
I hear folk talk about it.

162
00:11:01,306 --> 00:11:02,961
You didn't hear anything last night ?

163
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:06,986
I sleep. Not hear noise.

164
00:11:08,357 --> 00:11:11,203
But when the Germans started to run amok ?

165
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,810
I sleep. Not hear noise.

166
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,635
Well then ?

167
00:11:35,436 --> 00:11:38,177
You know I always got the dunce cap too.
It's not serious.

168
00:11:38,336 --> 00:11:39,117
Yes it is serious...

169
00:11:39,142 --> 00:11:42,105
When Papa finds out he'll give me a walloping.

170
00:11:42,257 --> 00:11:43,417
Well, all you have to do is not tell him.

171
00:11:43,595 --> 00:11:46,821
I thought policemen say you
always have to tell the truth !

172
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:49,345
In general yes, but there are exceptions.

173
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:54,387
So what have you done to earn the dunce cap
on the first day at school ?

174
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,173
I stole some of the quince jam.

175
00:11:57,198 --> 00:11:59,594
Right. Well, true enough, that's serious.

176
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:02,507
But it wasn't my fault. I was hungry.

177
00:12:02,714 --> 00:12:06,714
And there was only a small piece for two.
That's also not fair.

178
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:08,624
A little bit for two on the first day of school ?

179
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:13,517
There were supposed to be thieves last night,
but I'm sure its lies.

180
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:22,089
Please.

181
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:31,918
It's about the theft last night ?

182
00:12:32,064 --> 00:12:37,275
No. no, no. These gentlemen are from the Academy.
It's about the aircraft incident.

183
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,868
Sorry to arrive unannounced. 
We sent you a letter...

184
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,637
....but with the mail just now...

185
00:12:42,786 --> 00:12:45,086
Good. Go on. We can set up here.

186
00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:48,166
Don't worry, I'll stay with you.

187
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:50,403
Ah, you plan to attend the interview ?

188
00:12:51,532 --> 00:12:54,821
With respect it's the rule Monsieur l'Inspecteur.

189
00:12:54,846 --> 00:13:00,116
The head has the right to assist a teacher
in all disciplinary proceedings.

190
00:13:00,274 --> 00:13:02,674
Yes. One can, one can. But not 'One Must'.

191
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:06,994
That said, it's not inappropriate that you
be here, because if one thinks about it...

192
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,618
...all that Mademoiselle Borderie did on June 12th,
she did under your authority. Didn't she ?

193
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:14,243
Mademoiselle, sit down here please.

194
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,583
I wasn't present on the morning of June 12th.

195
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:23,811
And unaware. For as you know there wasn't
an official request to take the children out.

196
00:13:24,038 --> 00:13:28,538
Ah, yes. You weren't present. Where were you then ?

197
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:31,763
At Besançon where the Rector was giving me
the Academic Medal.

198
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:36,625
You are Jewish, Madame Morhange, I believe ?

199
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,519
Yes.

200
00:13:41,602 --> 00:13:42,953
I don't see the connection.

201
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:44,578
Oh, it's context.

202
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:49,185
Its part of the context. Context
is important in human affairs.

203
00:13:49,813 --> 00:13:53,713
Plato even said at a feast,
that it's the essence of things.

204
00:13:55,077 --> 00:13:57,136
Oh, I'm not an expert on Plato.

205
00:13:57,161 --> 00:13:58,661
No, of course, I can imagine.

206
00:13:58,758 --> 00:14:00,486
You prefer Spinoza, perhaps ?

207
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,812
I would like a moment. It's the Commissaire of Police.

208
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:09,864
Tell me, did you have a burglary last night ?

209
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:13,832
Oh, yes. We were robbed of bits and pieces.
I was going to tell you about it later...

210
00:14:13,868 --> 00:14:15,254
Can it wait ?
No.

211
00:14:15,302 --> 00:14:16,980
But I wont keep you long.

212
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:20,218
Can we suspend things a moment,
while I accompany the Commissaire ?

213
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:22,926
Oh yes. Go on, don't worry.

214
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,812
Good.

215
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:32,237
It was the Canteen worker who
discovered it this morning.

216
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,466
Apparently he's missing a ham and half,...

217
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:39,109
....some honey and quince jam.

218
00:14:41,658 --> 00:14:43,370
Well that's annoying but not the end of the world.

219
00:14:43,395 --> 00:14:46,695
Right, but nevertheless
a ham and a half...right now !

220
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:49,497
You sleep up there, do you ?
Well yes, with the young teacher.

221
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:52,206
With the Germans in occupation
alongside it's a real war.

222
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,123
Can I question her, just a minute.

223
00:14:54,187 --> 00:14:57,507
Are you kidding. She's already being taken apart
by two morons from the Academy...

224
00:14:57,532 --> 00:14:59,932
Good. In any case she heard and saw nothing.

225
00:15:01,926 --> 00:15:03,993
Just a moment there Madame.

226
00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:06,910
In my view the thief came in here...

227
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,201
... and left by the window using the cable,
and then crashed down.

228
00:15:11,762 --> 00:15:15,008
Anyway, it's clearly a robbery and not sabotage.

229
00:15:15,757 --> 00:15:18,046
Let's hope the Fritz are satisfied with that.

230
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:20,366
You'd like so much to satisfy them ?

231
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,390
We can't all do what we like, you know.

232
00:15:26,338 --> 00:15:30,530
On reflection, have you come to terms with
your responsibility for the children's deaths ?

233
00:15:32,336 --> 00:15:33,610
I don't know, Monsieur.

234
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,402
What do you mean, you don't know ?

235
00:15:38,402 --> 00:15:41,531
If... if we had stayed in class...

236
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:43,956
... a bomb could have fallen on the school.

237
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:48,589
At Champeix, a bomb fell squarely on the class.

238
00:15:49,452 --> 00:15:51,407
The teacher and seven children were killed.

239
00:15:51,526 --> 00:15:52,591
This is incredible !

240
00:15:53,695 --> 00:15:57,105
You talk about what could have happened.
We are talking about what did happen.

241
00:15:57,236 --> 00:16:00,648
You went out with the children. 
A plane came. They were killed.

242
00:16:02,342 --> 00:16:06,208
Yes...
You don't understand that if you hadn't gone
out that day the children would be alive ?

243
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:08,111
Yes.

244
00:16:08,136 --> 00:16:11,036
It's behaviour like this that 
has got us where we are today.

245
00:16:12,648 --> 00:16:16,048
Thinking that everything is allowed. 
Thinking that one can...

246
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:19,666
Rules are made to be followed, Mademoiselle.

247
00:16:20,517 --> 00:16:24,217
Because of your whim, France has lost
two of its children.

248
00:16:25,774 --> 00:16:28,179
Then, you're not solely responsible, agreed...

249
00:16:28,638 --> 00:16:31,724
... however I would really like to hear you,
acknowledge your fault.

250
00:16:33,787 --> 00:16:35,587
Excuse me, I didn't hear you.

251
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:50,452
I am responsible.. it's my fault.

252
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,653
My God...

253
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:54,343
Sign here.

254
00:16:54,505 --> 00:16:56,752
Name and surname, if you please.

255
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,426
Well then, I believe we're finished.

256
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:10,916
I understood that we'd suspended the session.

257
00:17:11,056 --> 00:17:14,864
Ah. The Regulations say nothing about what
to do when the Headmistress absents herself.

258
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,450
And then Mademoiselle Borderie,
spoke to us spontaneously...

259
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:19,675
... its better for her anyway.

260
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:25,607
Madame Morhange.
When will we know the follow-up to this matter ?

261
00:17:25,736 --> 00:17:27,156
Quickly, I think.

262
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:32,420
Finally, I hardly see how one can let someone teach,
who can't see the difference between...

263
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:34,145
.....the possible and reality.

264
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:48,482
How could you have signed the document.
Couldn't you have waited until I returned ?

265
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:52,629
But it's true. I am responsible. It's true.

266
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,057
No ! That's not the issue.

267
00:17:54,082 --> 00:17:55,947
These men were not here...

268
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:59,398
... they were not here to find the truth.
They were here to...

269
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:03,615
In these cases you should never sign anything.
You're really in trouble now.

270
00:18:28,481 --> 00:18:30,550
Shit !

271
00:18:49,301 --> 00:18:54,069
...et..... trois....... kinder....           Children.....        Children !

272
00:18:55,273 --> 00:18:57,614
Hannes, Rupert and Alma

273
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,496
I have one: Marceau.

274
00:19:00,381 --> 00:19:04,362
Marceau. Only one son ?

275
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:07,559
Can I talk to her ? I work with her.
Work...?

276
00:19:08,921 --> 00:19:09,921
Yes

277
00:19:10,276 --> 00:19:12,184
Only speak, eh....       Speak....

278
00:19:12,705 --> 00:19:15,516
I can't cross but he says that I can come up to here.

279
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:16,448
What's happening ?

280
00:19:16,473 --> 00:19:18,445
Ah, I have a problem with my Ausweis.

281
00:19:22,406 --> 00:19:24,565
I have bad news, Marie.

282
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36,842
It's Lorrain.
Yes.

283
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:42,959
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:21,992 --> 00:20:24,592
They don't even say what happened.

285
00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:29,588
Behind the barrier !

286
00:20:29,643 --> 00:20:30,668
Don't cross the Line.

287
00:20:30,714 --> 00:20:32,581
She just lost her husband, so shut up.

288
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,100
Don't cross the Line.

289
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,445
I'm going to tell the kids.

290
00:20:39,782 --> 00:20:41,849
Madame, go back. Quickly !

291
00:20:47,124 --> 00:20:48,886
I'll return tomorrow.

292
00:20:50,347 --> 00:20:51,830
I'm with you.

293
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:53,607
I'm thinking of you.

294
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,370
Her husband was killed in the war.

295
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:05,693
Ah. ... the war.   Not Good.

296
00:21:06,418 --> 00:21:07,418
Excuse me.

297
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:11,169
We think that that a thief got into the school pantry.

298
00:21:11,194 --> 00:21:12,584
Climbing down the facade...

299
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:17,927
...the thief, by chance pulled down the military cable.

300
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:20,275
The cable ran near the window...

301
00:21:20,703 --> 00:21:22,203
... he used it like a rope.

302
00:21:22,593 --> 00:21:28,220
You really think that a burglar picked a place
where 20 German soldiers were sleeping !

303
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:31,491
Perhaps he didn't know. It's got 'School'
written on the wall.

304
00:21:31,516 --> 00:21:33,216
... not German Barracks.

305
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:38,141
Listen Kommandant, if, as we believe,
it's really a case of food theft...

306
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:41,860
...the thief isn't from round here, because
he didn't know the school had become a barracks.

307
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,885
He's long gone now. We'll not catch him.

308
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,210
That's not my problem.

309
00:21:46,845 --> 00:21:51,861
Meanwhile, I want the list of 20 names
that I asked for this morning.

310
00:21:57,812 --> 00:21:59,579
What is this list for Kommandant ?

311
00:21:59,734 --> 00:22:05,969
They're the names of volunteers who are accountable
for the nightly guarding of military cables.

312
00:22:06,128 --> 00:22:10,727
Along the railways, because that's
where saboteurs are found.

313
00:22:11,192 --> 00:22:18,510
Understand, if another sabotage takes place
they'll be held responsible.

314
00:22:18,793 --> 00:22:21,749
You can't ask these men to be out all night.

315
00:22:21,855 --> 00:22:22,597
They work.

316
00:22:22,653 --> 00:22:26,007
A nightly guard until the saboteur's arrest.

317
00:22:26,331 --> 00:22:30,031
The first guard will be tonight.

318
00:22:42,992 --> 00:22:47,654
Daniel Larcher, Henri de Kervern.

319
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:53,601
I didn't think that you would
put yourself on the list.

320
00:23:04,459 --> 00:23:05,659
What news ?

321
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,784
There's an important Comrade who wants to see you.

322
00:23:08,182 --> 00:23:09,041
Where ?

323
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:10,581
At Les Essarts.

324
00:23:11,615 --> 00:23:13,461
It's on the other side of the Line.

325
00:23:13,486 --> 00:23:14,886
Comrade, it's a Party Order.

326
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:17,069
The Comrade has taken risks to meet with you.

327
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:18,694
The Party is counting on you.

328
00:23:20,112 --> 00:23:22,472
How am I going to cross the Line
without an Ausweis?

329
00:23:23,614 --> 00:23:25,627
You know the old railway tunnel at Poligny?

330
00:23:25,962 --> 00:23:28,524
There's a 20 metre passage that leads to
the Unoccupied Zone.

331
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:30,920
It's not guarded at night,
neither one end nor the other.

332
00:23:30,945 --> 00:23:32,650
You come back next night, it's a piece of cake.

333
00:23:33,717 --> 00:23:36,320
But that means leaving during the curfew...

334
00:23:37,004 --> 00:23:38,780
And, I remind you, I have a kid....

335
00:23:38,878 --> 00:23:40,241
....that my wife is ill in bed.

336
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:43,984
We all have wives and kids Comrade.
Lots of Comrades are in prison.

337
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,117
What time is the meeting ?

338
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,042
Nine o'clock in front of the Great Oak Calvaire.

339
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,501
The Comrade will call himself Edmond.
You will call yourself Paul.

340
00:23:58,902 --> 00:24:02,704
Ask him for a light. He'll reply that he doesn't
smoke because it's bad for the throat.

341
00:24:03,677 --> 00:24:05,334
Above all be on time.

342
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,395
Has Maman been sleeping a while ?

343
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,620
She was already asleep when I came home from school.

344
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,048
What are you doing there ?

345
00:24:30,073 --> 00:24:32,107
I'm drawing lines for writing practice.

346
00:24:32,132 --> 00:24:33,632
For tomorrow.

347
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:41,249
Gustave, keep busy a while.

348
00:24:57,766 --> 00:24:59,431
This is crap.

349
00:25:00,352 --> 00:25:02,252
Max gave me a message.

350
00:25:02,906 --> 00:25:05,649
I have to meet a Comrade
on the other side of the Line tonight.

351
00:25:05,985 --> 00:25:07,385
I shall be away all tomorrow.

352
00:25:07,554 --> 00:25:09,442
If you must, you must !

353
00:25:09,836 --> 00:25:11,836
He says it's an important Comrade.

354
00:25:12,353 --> 00:25:14,489
Perhaps he has news from the Federation.

355
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:22,025
Don't jump on the bed, Gustave.

356
00:25:22,835 --> 00:25:25,091
How was school today ?

357
00:25:25,521 --> 00:25:29,821
Good, good, our pal, little Louis,
stole some quince jam.

358
00:25:30,357 --> 00:25:32,157
He even had to wear the dunce's cap.

359
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:33,756
You didn't tell on him, at least ?

360
00:25:33,827 --> 00:25:36,065
No !  
Well that's good.

361
00:25:37,323 --> 00:25:40,968
It's not nice to steal but it's worse to squeal.
Never forget that.

362
00:25:41,255 --> 00:25:44,555
Listen. I have something important to tell you.

363
00:25:45,262 --> 00:25:48,862
This evening I have to go out.
You're going to be alone with Maman.

364
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:50,826
But you're not allowed to go out at night.

365
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:52,651
I have an important errand to do.

366
00:25:53,033 --> 00:25:54,655
An errand that you shouldn't talk about to anyone.

367
00:25:54,782 --> 00:25:56,482
Not to your pals nor your teacher. Understand ?

368
00:25:58,268 --> 00:26:00,197
If you talk of it, something bad could happen to us.

369
00:26:11,084 --> 00:26:12,434
Please, Messieurs.

370
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:13,914
I little quiet please.

371
00:26:16,536 --> 00:26:21,156
Messieurs there will be four groups,
each with two German soldiers.

372
00:26:21,674 --> 00:26:22,365
Armed ?

373
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,650
Of course not.

374
00:26:24,096 --> 00:26:26,362
And what do we do if we see something
or someone ? What do we do ?

375
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:34,083
Well....
You come to see me or Inspecteur Marchetti.

376
00:26:34,237 --> 00:26:37,537
There are four groups. We'll be separated
from each other. How will we communicate ?

377
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,393
Well if you see something you warn
the German soldiers, and then that's it.

378
00:26:42,828 --> 00:26:44,628
Please. Please.

379
00:26:44,764 --> 00:26:47,893
Anyway you won't see a saboteur,
because there won't be any sabotage.

380
00:26:49,751 --> 00:26:53,770
It's useless. It's done especially to
humiliate us, and make us feel they're the masters.

381
00:26:55,418 --> 00:26:59,181
Don't fall into the mistake of
bickering about the details.

382
00:27:00,156 --> 00:27:02,135
Please. Please. Please !

383
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:05,568
Are there to be sleep breaks,
so we're not all washed out ?

384
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:11,153
No, von Ritter was categorical. No-one sleeps.
The guards will be watching us.

385
00:27:13,403 --> 00:27:14,885
There's not only bad news !

386
00:27:15,855 --> 00:27:20,355
There's not only bad news ! The Préfecture
and Sous-Préfecture have decided to compensate us.

387
00:27:22,538 --> 00:27:24,391
At a rate of seven francs a night.

388
00:27:24,673 --> 00:27:26,373
Well that's something.

389
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:30,948
Go on then. Leave in a quarter of an hour.

390
00:27:32,575 --> 00:27:34,206
Let's go, Messieurs.

391
00:28:30,947 --> 00:28:34,026
It's still incredible to be forced
to mount guard like squaddies.

392
00:28:35,421 --> 00:28:37,421
Squaddies without guns...

393
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:39,603
Reminds me of my youth.

394
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:42,284
You were really in the Great War ?

395
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,292
And was it as...    as hard as everyone says ?

396
00:28:45,613 --> 00:28:49,213
Oh during the War I wasn't on guard duty,
I was in a medical unit.

397
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:53,052
No. That was earlier. During my Military
Service in Brittany in 1913.

398
00:28:54,823 --> 00:28:58,974
By the way, did you inform Marie Germain,
in spite of the invalidity of Ausweis?
Yes.

399
00:29:00,561 --> 00:29:03,236
And about an Ausweis, can you get me one?

400
00:29:04,573 --> 00:29:07,473
With my sub-contractors it would
definitely be more convenient.

401
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:11,047
No. Von Ritter is absolutely furious
about the cable.

402
00:29:12,222 --> 00:29:15,046
I suppose he had his chain jerked by his superiors.

403
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:19,393
In any case it's better for now to do nothing,
apart from catching our thief.

404
00:29:21,382 --> 00:29:24,565
In fact I may have a means of getting Ausweis.

405
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,768
I'd like to know what you think of it.

406
00:29:30,647 --> 00:29:33,202
Von Ritter has suggested
that I work for the Kommandantur.

407
00:29:34,283 --> 00:29:36,983
He needs wood to extend the barracks
at the boys' school.

408
00:29:39,008 --> 00:29:41,641
Right, that would solve the Ausweiss question.

409
00:29:43,013 --> 00:29:44,613
What do you think ?

410
00:29:46,193 --> 00:29:47,562
Of what ?

411
00:29:48,694 --> 00:29:50,285
Of von Ritter's proposal.

412
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:57,130
I'm sure that the Sous-Préfet will like it.

413
00:30:00,283 --> 00:30:01,883
And you ?

414
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:07,942
You think that all this delights me ?

415
00:30:08,123 --> 00:30:09,352
It must be done well.

416
00:30:10,482 --> 00:30:12,916
We lost the war. We have to try and win the peace.

417
00:30:14,607 --> 00:30:18,005
Moreover the instructions of the Préfecture
are very clear. The economy must be restored.

418
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:22,527
And as of now, only the Fritz' have money...

419
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,089
Halt, Halt, Halt !

420
00:30:42,893 --> 00:30:45,493
Halt. Don't move !

421
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,182
What do we do ?

422
00:31:10,407 --> 00:31:11,977
Who is this clown ?

423
00:31:12,002 --> 00:31:13,802
He's a guy who wants to cross the Line.

424
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,625
Where did you come from ?

425
00:31:16,832 --> 00:31:18,719
I'm walking. Don't I have the right to walk ?

426
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:21,444
No, not a dead of night. Go on. On your knees.

427
00:31:21,707 --> 00:31:25,582
Saboteur ! Just a guy who wants to cross the Line.

428
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,171
Go on. Throw him in the hole. Get his life history.

429
00:31:28,196 --> 00:31:30,127
No-one moves before 8 in the morning.

430
00:31:30,338 --> 00:31:33,000
I'm taking him to the Commissariat de Police.
I'm the Commissaire.

431
00:31:33,897 --> 00:31:37,759
Good. You keep him. He can keep you company.
He'll keep you busy.

432
00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:40,065
I've had enough. Shit !

433
00:31:41,423 --> 00:31:43,024
Boss ? Commissaire ?

434
00:31:45,979 --> 00:31:47,279
De Kervern ?

435
00:31:47,395 --> 00:31:48,106
What's wrong with you ?

436
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:50,031
He's had this problem for a long time.

437
00:31:51,421 --> 00:31:53,181
Angina, he needs Vilcanol.

438
00:31:53,206 --> 00:31:54,340
We need to take him to my office.

439
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,848
Herr Hauptmann !    Dont move !

440
00:31:57,242 --> 00:32:01,469
But this man is having a heart attack. He may die.

441
00:32:01,768 --> 00:32:04,727
He told you... Police ! French Police, in the Name of God !

442
00:32:04,752 --> 00:32:05,752
Don't move !

443
00:32:05,777 --> 00:32:07,377
Call your Kommandant.
De Kervern ?

444
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:10,027
We're going OK. That's enough. Stand up.

445
00:32:10,052 --> 00:32:11,552
My car is back there.

446
00:32:11,589 --> 00:32:12,258
Don't move !

447
00:32:12,283 --> 00:32:14,645
Do you know what you're doing ?
He won't shoot at Police.

448
00:32:14,714 --> 00:32:16,513
Herr Hauptmann ! Don't move !

449
00:32:17,031 --> 00:32:18,429
I'm going to shoot.

450
00:32:23,991 --> 00:32:26,001
Shit !

451
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,728
What's going on ?

452
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:46,453
He's had a heart attack. Your husband says
that he needs Vilcanol tablets.

453
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:49,478
Get him into the lounge. And Daniel ?

454
00:32:49,747 --> 00:32:50,797
He stayed with the others.

455
00:32:50,822 --> 00:32:52,122
Don't worry. All is well.

456
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:55,441
I really chose a good time. Huh ?

457
00:32:55,466 --> 00:32:56,611
I'm sorry to bother you.

458
00:32:56,636 --> 00:33:00,850
No. You're absolutely not bothering me.
Lie down and try to sleep a little.

459
00:33:01,704 --> 00:33:03,604
I am going to look for capsules.

460
00:33:03,629 --> 00:33:04,529
Very well.

461
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,440
Thank you.

462
00:33:16,687 --> 00:33:17,987
Here.

463
00:33:18,155 --> 00:33:19,455
Take this.

464
00:33:23,115 --> 00:33:27,915
Thank you.  I can rest a little, OK,
but certainly not sleep.

465
00:33:28,646 --> 00:33:30,900
I'll have to go back. Do you think you can manage ?

466
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,425
Yes, of course.

467
00:33:32,498 --> 00:33:34,769
Relax and breathe, OK ? 
I'll be back.

468
00:33:34,934 --> 00:33:36,434
Good. Right away.

469
00:33:40,015 --> 00:33:42,514
I know it's a bad time, but I want to thank you.

470
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:45,639
For what... ?
Well that you agreed to give me lodging...

471
00:33:46,552 --> 00:33:49,695
... but if my presence bothers you, say so.
I can always find something else.

472
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:52,149
There's a camp bed in the loft of the Commissariat.

473
00:33:52,174 --> 00:33:54,574
No, not at all. I am quite happy for you to be here.

474
00:33:54,805 --> 00:33:56,021
Very good.

475
00:34:23,514 --> 00:34:25,206
Edmond ?

476
00:34:25,698 --> 00:34:27,414
Good God, be more discreet!

477
00:34:29,348 --> 00:34:31,458
You should be more punctual. I've waited an hour.

478
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:32,583
Do you live on German time Paul?

479
00:34:33,441 --> 00:34:35,990
Here in the Unoccupied Zone we live
on French Time. It's 9 o'clock.

480
00:34:36,715 --> 00:34:39,015
You shouldn't stay more than
two minutes at a rendez-vous.

481
00:34:39,951 --> 00:34:41,663
You didn't give me the security phrase
about your throat.

482
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:44,334
Let's walk.

483
00:34:44,931 --> 00:34:46,515
Do you have contact with the Federation ?

484
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:47,888
Or the Leadership ?

485
00:34:48,022 --> 00:34:49,122
Why ?

486
00:34:49,385 --> 00:34:50,885
I don't know...

487
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:52,566
... for the evolution of the Party Line.

488
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:53,942
I've had nothing since June.

489
00:34:53,978 --> 00:34:55,278
It hasn't changed.

490
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,500
We hold to the Line of the Nazi-Soviet Pact.
Comrade Stalin knows what he's doing.

491
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:01,536
It's on Pétain and Laval that
we need to focus our attacks.

492
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:03,759
Pétain, Laval, the 200 Families...

493
00:35:04,275 --> 00:35:06,175
The plutocrats of London and Vichy.

494
00:35:06,517 --> 00:35:08,217
We don't say anything about the Germans ?

495
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,372
The Germans ...  are a typical false problem.

496
00:35:11,334 --> 00:35:13,510
The enemy is the Nazi, not the German.

497
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:16,092
Most German soldiers are not Nazis.

498
00:35:16,318 --> 00:35:19,088
They are Workers in uniform, Paul.
Workers like us.

499
00:35:19,295 --> 00:35:21,095
Listen, I understand of course, but...

500
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,853
... but to recruit people with this Line
is simply impossible.

501
00:35:23,954 --> 00:35:25,254
Why ?

502
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,206
Because in the Occupied Zone the
Germans are the problem, not Pétain.

503
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,549
Requisitions, the curfew, harassment. It's the Germans.

504
00:35:31,685 --> 00:35:35,620
Paul, you're questioning the Party Line !

505
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:40,043
Excuse me.

506
00:35:43,835 --> 00:35:47,761
I've to tell you that you've been named
political head of the Villeneuve sector.

507
00:35:48,335 --> 00:35:50,835
Recruit Comrades, and spread the Party Line.

508
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:54,893
Behind the Calvaire, under some stones,you'll
find 100 papers to distribute as soon as possible.

509
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,170
Get on with it. For us it's gold.

510
00:35:57,933 --> 00:36:00,033
Slide them under doors, and in letterboxes.

511
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,368
You've understand what the Party expects of you ?

512
00:36:06,018 --> 00:36:07,459
Yes.

513
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,730
One last thing.

514
00:36:12,699 --> 00:36:14,699
My boss may do work for the Germans.

515
00:36:15,954 --> 00:36:17,543
That's a problem ?

516
00:36:18,295 --> 00:36:19,703
If I stay in the company ?

517
00:36:19,843 --> 00:36:23,054
On the contrary, I've told you
the Germans are not the enemy.

518
00:36:25,234 --> 00:36:30,146
And if that changes... we won't be unhappy
to have Comrades in place, working for them.

519
00:36:32,674 --> 00:36:33,874
Good day, Sarah.

520
00:36:33,899 --> 00:36:34,912
Monsieur.

521
00:36:34,937 --> 00:36:36,924
Ah, make me something to eat.

522
00:36:37,347 --> 00:36:39,147
....some wine, some cheese...

523
00:36:39,252 --> 00:36:41,752
I'll go and see what I can find
but it won't be much, you know.

524
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,091
Did Marceau sleep well ?

525
00:36:44,116 --> 00:36:45,916
No. He still has nightmares.

526
00:36:53,207 --> 00:36:54,646
So, your night guard duty ?

527
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,370
Cruel !

528
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,515
By the way, de Kerven failed to complete it.
He had a heart attack.

529
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,940
Oh, poor man. Is he improving ?

530
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:02,667
Well, I hope so. He's a good guy.

531
00:37:04,312 --> 00:37:06,061
Indeed, there's not much.

532
00:37:06,086 --> 00:37:07,286
I do my best, Monsieur.

533
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,525
No, I don't blame you, Sarah.

534
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:13,526
How am I going to work after such a night.

535
00:37:13,551 --> 00:37:15,251
My poor love !

536
00:37:15,821 --> 00:37:17,921
The Germans really treat us like...

537
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,420
... like slaves.

538
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:21,459
Clémenceau was right, France is dead.

539
00:37:22,488 --> 00:37:25,229
Well, I don't know, but I had
a curious proposition yesterday.

540
00:37:25,821 --> 00:37:28,280
Kreiskommandant von Ritter offered me a deal.

541
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:30,359
.. and an important deal.

542
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,380
... which will bail out our bank accounts.

543
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:34,983
... beams and planks for the Boys' School.

544
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,108
He'll pay in francs ?

545
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:37,933
In Reichmarks.

546
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:39,681
Than accept. It's a windfall.

547
00:37:39,706 --> 00:37:40,669
All the same !

548
00:37:40,978 --> 00:37:42,742
What will people think ? Working for the Germans !

549
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:44,031
That you're lucky.

550
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:46,047
Tell your father. He doesn't like the Boches much.

551
00:37:46,072 --> 00:37:47,484
Yes. But believe me he likes Reichmarks.

552
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:50,109
The exchange rate does nothing
for Franco-German friendship.

553
00:37:52,736 --> 00:37:56,441
Good !... The problem is, that if I accept...

554
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,800
I'll have to go regularly to Berthier's.

555
00:38:02,742 --> 00:38:04,560
I'll even need to send a guy there from time to time.

556
00:38:04,814 --> 00:38:07,102
You could sleep at the farm. It's quite close.

557
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,960
Did you tell Marie about Lorrain?

558
00:38:14,413 --> 00:38:16,254
Yes.
How did she react ?

559
00:38:16,398 --> 00:38:17,798
Ah, not well. Obviously.

560
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:19,927
Oh, the poor thing.

561
00:38:21,446 --> 00:38:23,246
Von Ritter didn't want to know.

562
00:38:23,965 --> 00:38:25,798
The guard is on again for tonight.

563
00:38:26,376 --> 00:38:27,809
What a misery !

564
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:29,174
What can we do ?

565
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:30,332
I don't know.

566
00:38:30,357 --> 00:38:32,668
As for the thief....any trace ?

567
00:38:32,736 --> 00:38:33,736
No.

568
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:36,258
You know. I'm a bit like you. I've hardly slept.

569
00:38:36,427 --> 00:38:37,702
Yes of course.

570
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:39,299
Excuse me.

571
00:38:41,229 --> 00:38:43,229
You were great last night.

572
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:45,179
What happened ?

573
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,090
Nothing. It's ... not important.

574
00:38:48,156 --> 00:38:51,319
The Germans didn't want Commissaire de Kervern
taken away, when he had his attack...

575
00:38:51,344 --> 00:38:53,644
... and Inspecteur Marchetti took him anyway.

576
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:57,172
In spite of being threatened by a soldier with a gun.

577
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,310
You know, in those moments you don't think.

578
00:39:00,621 --> 00:39:01,425
Up already ?

579
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,090
Do you feel better ?

580
00:39:03,537 --> 00:39:06,210
All somersaults. I was wakened
by hunger. May I ?

581
00:39:06,235 --> 00:39:09,935
Yes. Of course. Sit down.
Maria, a plate for the Commissaire.

582
00:39:11,785 --> 00:39:13,484
I will examine you in a moment.

583
00:39:13,759 --> 00:39:15,259
You don't look too bad.

584
00:39:16,213 --> 00:39:18,065
Any news ? 
No. Nothing.

585
00:39:18,185 --> 00:39:20,185
What's going to be done with
the guy we arrested last night ?

586
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:22,862
We'll charge him with assault and battery.

587
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:28,947
That ham there....
It's not good ?

588
00:39:30,249 --> 00:39:32,070
Certainly. Yes... but...

589
00:39:32,424 --> 00:39:33,979
... where did you get it ?

590
00:39:34,251 --> 00:39:37,196
You'll have to ask our magician. Maria ?

591
00:39:37,317 --> 00:39:38,766
The ham ?

592
00:39:39,116 --> 00:39:40,176
It came from Fernandez.

593
00:39:40,273 --> 00:39:43,040
No. No. Fernandez hasn't had any since the Spring.

594
00:39:45,707 --> 00:39:48,506
So, Maria, tell us where the ham came from.

595
00:39:50,034 --> 00:39:54,130
I'm sorry Monsieur. It came from
Clémentine, the clothes mender.

596
00:39:54,155 --> 00:39:56,904
Monsieur Marek, the school handyman, sold it to her.

597
00:39:58,725 --> 00:40:01,125
Bring it here, please.

598
00:40:09,872 --> 00:40:11,372
Thank you.

599
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:16,055
This is the Commissary mark.

600
00:40:16,671 --> 00:40:19,512
It's the ham that was stolen
from the school the other night.

601
00:40:24,577 --> 00:40:26,977
You know the black market is forbidden ?

602
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:30,125
Not black market. Just help each other.

603
00:40:30,332 --> 00:40:32,332
You have a funny way of helping each other !

604
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:35,311
Ten times the official price.

605
00:40:35,374 --> 00:40:37,774
Official price for shops.

606
00:40:37,918 --> 00:40:39,536
But in shop, no ham.

607
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:43,895
Stop it Marek, we know the song, words and music.
Where did you get the ham ?

608
00:40:44,038 --> 00:40:46,056
I... it mine.

609
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:48,851
You want us to believe that you have the money
to buy a ham and a half.

610
00:40:48,934 --> 00:40:50,871
Not buy. Is gift.

611
00:40:50,987 --> 00:40:53,619
Ah good. And who gave you this present ?

612
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,572
Monsieur Fournier, teacher.

613
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:59,886
Do work for him at school and give ham.

614
00:41:00,088 --> 00:41:02,144
Marek is so intelligent!

615
00:41:02,262 --> 00:41:03,567
Making the dead speak.

616
00:41:03,592 --> 00:41:05,320
When was that ?

617
00:41:05,926 --> 00:41:07,442
In month May.

618
00:41:07,528 --> 00:41:10,023
That's a shame because there's a stamp on this ham...

619
00:41:10,203 --> 00:41:12,003
... it was made in August.

620
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:16,350
Marek, you're going to have to stop
screwing us around, huh.

621
00:41:16,553 --> 00:41:20,629
One, lying to the Police; 
Two, theft; Three, black market. 
This is starting to be a big deal.

622
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,353
No stolen. Found, no stolen !

623
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:25,699
Found then ... where ?

624
00:41:26,603 --> 00:41:29,903
That night, hear noise.

625
00:41:31,824 --> 00:41:37,351
Commotion. I go window. See run.

626
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:41,459
Throw bag, yellow. And I get ham.

627
00:41:41,484 --> 00:41:43,198
Who was this man ?

628
00:41:43,356 --> 00:41:48,548
Leave, run, happen. Germans come. Not see.

629
00:41:48,682 --> 00:41:49,822
Good. I'll call Monsieur le Maire.

630
00:41:49,847 --> 00:41:51,716
No. Not stolen, found.

631
00:41:51,741 --> 00:41:52,741
Tell him we've got the thief.

632
00:41:52,766 --> 00:41:55,921
The honey and the quince jam, Marek ?

633
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,429
Honey, I keep.

634
00:41:59,301 --> 00:42:01,253
Not quince jam.

635
00:42:01,674 --> 00:42:03,594
Honey, ham...

636
00:42:12,149 --> 00:42:13,876
Good. Then it's him ?

637
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:15,501
You're sure of it ?

638
00:42:16,417 --> 00:42:20,694
He sold the ham on the black market, he was
on the scene because he sleeps in the school.

639
00:42:23,198 --> 00:42:25,073
You don't agree, or what ?

640
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,562
He admits the ham and honey but not the quince jam.

641
00:42:28,722 --> 00:42:33,622
So a guy who admits stealing the big thing but not the
little ones, I've never seen that in all my career.

642
00:42:33,853 --> 00:42:36,518
All the same, you know, criminal logic...

643
00:42:36,911 --> 00:42:40,424
Good, lets accept that he stole the ham.
But Marek lives there...

644
00:42:40,449 --> 00:42:43,349
Why does he go out by the window ?
Why the acrobatics ?

645
00:42:43,424 --> 00:42:47,224
He had only to pinch the ham, take it to where
he sleeps and then leave with it a little later.

646
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:50,697
I don't know. He could have been surprised
in the pantry. He would have panicked.

647
00:42:50,722 --> 00:42:52,022
I don't believe it.

648
00:42:52,204 --> 00:42:54,550
What's more he's too old to climb down the cable.

649
00:42:54,593 --> 00:42:58,908
No. It's someone else who did the robbery,
who panicked when the Germans arrived,
and abandoned the ham there.

650
00:42:58,933 --> 00:43:01,033
Marek arrived. He found the ham. There you go !

651
00:43:01,481 --> 00:43:03,986
Good. In any case the black market case is established...

652
00:43:04,011 --> 00:43:06,311
... and accessory to the theft.

653
00:43:08,014 --> 00:43:09,704
Good.

654
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,511
Monsieur le Maire, what do we do ?

655
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:19,527
We can't miss a chance of calming down the Germans.

656
00:43:20,445 --> 00:43:25,184
In any case Marek has lied to the Police.
He's worked the black market. Yes.

657
00:43:25,326 --> 00:43:26,507
He's an accessory to robbery.

658
00:43:26,532 --> 00:43:28,965
Technically. Finally there's concealment.

659
00:43:29,048 --> 00:43:32,648
It's for the judge to decide his fate, not us...

660
00:43:33,395 --> 00:43:38,204
I'm going to warn the Sous-Préfet
that we've found one of those responsible
for the damage to the cable.

661
00:43:38,913 --> 00:43:41,275
Will you call Justice at Besançon ?

662
00:43:42,443 --> 00:43:45,301
Monsieur le Sous-Préfet, please.
The Mayor of Villeneuve.

663
00:43:54,818 --> 00:43:57,718
I am very satisfied with this arrangement.

664
00:43:57,957 --> 00:44:01,924
Don't be surprised. There will have to be
an investigation by our Security Service...

665
00:44:02,212 --> 00:44:07,412
They'll want the names of your employees
and a plan of the factory. It's routine.

666
00:44:07,691 --> 00:44:08,999
Yes, I understand.

667
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:11,724
Respect for the schedule is very important.

668
00:44:12,353 --> 00:44:16,053
German insistence on punctuality is not a myth.

669
00:44:17,261 --> 00:44:22,861
I'll try to supply you with petrol
for the duration of the work.

670
00:44:24,005 --> 00:44:29,170
But I promise nothing.
Finally a permanent priority Ausweiss...

671
00:44:29,195 --> 00:44:33,095
With that you can cross the Line
as many times as necessary.

672
00:44:35,258 --> 00:44:36,582
Thank you.

673
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,296
Hauptmann !

674
00:44:40,954 --> 00:44:44,419
Hello ? Ah my dear Servier !

675
00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:48,911
You've found the saboteur.

676
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,662
Bravo !

677
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:56,267
The Sous-Préfet says von Ritter is delighted.

678
00:44:56,292 --> 00:44:58,608
He thinks there'll be no more
guarding, from tonight on.

679
00:44:59,607 --> 00:45:01,893
You could say that we were scared, eh ?

680
00:45:02,213 --> 00:45:04,104
And Marek ? What will he get ?

681
00:45:04,215 --> 00:45:06,151
Oh, a few months.

682
00:45:06,283 --> 00:45:08,383
Black market !

683
00:45:18,598 --> 00:45:24,701
I've come to take charge of the prisoner, Marek Dutchya,
who's sought by the German Army for sabotage.

684
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,660
But ... this has to be an error.

685
00:45:26,946 --> 00:45:28,994
This man has been arrested by the French Police...

686
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:31,138
He should be judged by French Justice.

687
00:45:31,239 --> 00:45:36,619
I have a formal order to take charge of this man.
An order signed by Kreiskommandant Helmut von Ritter.

688
00:45:36,644 --> 00:45:38,244
I have to execute the order.

689
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:40,169
It's a violation of the Armistice Convention.

690
00:45:40,194 --> 00:45:41,636
Check with your superiors.

691
00:45:41,661 --> 00:45:43,931
We are not going to let this happen !

692
00:45:44,866 --> 00:45:47,005
I'll call the Sous-Préfet again.

693
00:45:55,774 --> 00:45:58,874
Monsieur le Sous-Préfet, please.
The Mayor of Villeneuve.

694
00:46:10,095 --> 00:46:11,973
Servier, it's Larcher again.

695
00:46:12,005 --> 00:46:15,446
We've a problem. German soldiers are here,
wanting to take the ham thief away.

696
00:46:15,427 --> 00:46:16,284
He's ours !

697
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:21,909
The Germans want him. We're not going to
stand on ceremony, he's a black marketeer,
a thief, and what's more, a foreigner.

698
00:46:22,315 --> 00:46:23,651
I don't see what the problem is.

699
00:46:23,676 --> 00:46:28,082
It's a matter of principle. Our Police have
arrested him to bring him before French justice.

700
00:46:28,214 --> 00:46:29,952
The French State upholds the Rule of Law.

701
00:46:29,977 --> 00:46:34,777
There's only one principle that counts, to be
willing to look after our citizen's interests.

702
00:46:34,802 --> 00:46:39,702
Von Ritter tells me the parcel issue can be sorted out.
As for the curfew, it goes back to 20:00h.

703
00:46:39,822 --> 00:46:41,844
... we're not going to piss them off
for a shady foreigner !

704
00:46:42,324 --> 00:46:44,203
Anyway, we haven't a choice.

705
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,374
Go ahead.

706
00:47:03,576 --> 00:47:05,540
We haven't a choice.

707
00:47:27,126 --> 00:47:28,601
Open.

708
00:47:30,295 --> 00:47:31,882
Marek.

709
00:47:41,113 --> 00:47:43,164
Why ?     Eh ?.

710
00:47:46,632 --> 00:47:49,732
It not fair ! Not thief.

711
00:47:51,534 --> 00:47:53,434
Not thief.

712
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:56,291
Not steal !

713
00:48:01,863 --> 00:48:03,462
Why do that ?

714
00:48:03,907 --> 00:48:05,566
Why do that ?

715
00:48:31,393 --> 00:48:33,193
De Kervern.

716
00:48:34,034 --> 00:48:35,966
Yes, one moment.

717
00:48:38,299 --> 00:48:40,028
Monsieur le Maire.

718
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:41,851
It's for you.

719
00:48:48,297 --> 00:48:49,836
Larcher.

720
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:51,946
What ?

721
00:48:52,226 --> 00:48:54,126
Oh, My God.

722
00:48:54,238 --> 00:48:56,138
I'll be there right away.

723
00:48:58,369 --> 00:49:00,625
A family emergency.

724
00:49:01,422 --> 00:49:05,998
In spite of the circumstances,
I want to thank you for your work.

725
00:49:16,804 --> 00:49:18,828
It went pretty well.

726
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,322
Yes, except for Marek.

727
00:49:23,432 --> 00:49:25,332
And the other one. What should we do ?

728
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,304
Remand him ?

729
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:45,902
What's that ?

730
00:49:47,382 --> 00:49:48,804
It's paper.

731
00:49:48,876 --> 00:49:50,608
Give it to me.

732
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:14,153
Get about your business ..... before they shoot you.

733
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:16,566
Go !

734
00:51:36,512 --> 00:51:38,612
Was it you who got the Priest here ?

735
00:51:40,622 --> 00:51:42,522
She was born a Catholic.

736
00:51:45,153 --> 00:51:47,061
Go away.

737
00:51:50,715 --> 00:51:52,715
You go away too.

738
00:51:55,628 --> 00:51:57,393
My condolences, Marcel.

739
00:51:59,085 --> 00:52:00,985
If you need anything whatever...

740
00:52:01,605 --> 00:52:03,555
Yes. Go away !

741
00:52:11,924 --> 00:52:16,127
You said that if I said anything,
something bad would happen...

742
00:52:18,294 --> 00:52:20,250
... but I never said anything, Papa.

743
00:52:23,238 --> 00:52:24,893
I never said anything.

744
