1
00:00:00,435 --> 00:00:07,594
Numerous units of the German Navy are docked
in North Sea ports, the Channel and the Atlantic Coast.

2
00:00:08,368 --> 00:00:10,868
Minesweepers accompany the formation.

3
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:13,589
And here, fast patrol boats.

4
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:15,760
...German Stukas of the sea.

5
00:00:19,421 --> 00:00:22,542
Many powerful batteries of German coastal artillery...

6
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:24,211
...which dominate the Channel

7
00:00:24,253 --> 00:00:26,205
All hands to battle.

8
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,956
An enemy convoy is subject to violent fire
from German guns.

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:35,380
The English coastline and Port of Dover
are continually bombarded

10
00:00:35,737 --> 00:00:40,341
The southern extremity of the British coast
is entirely within range of the German guns.

11
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:47,295
It's cleaning time for German troops in France.

12
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:52,689
Antitank guns are cleaned...

13
00:00:53,651 --> 00:00:55,851
Look. I'm going to the toilet.

14
00:00:58,524 --> 00:01:01,937
Little streams are a good opportunity
to thoroughly clean these steel mastiffs.

15
00:01:03,972 --> 00:01:09,805
BLACK MARKETS

16
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:14,203
Yes. You have friends in the area ?

17
00:01:14,512 --> 00:01:16,112
OK !

18
00:01:23,977 --> 00:01:26,477
I can't bear not seeing you, any longer.

19
00:01:35,557 --> 00:01:38,820
Seeing each other won't help, only cause hurt.

20
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,747
I'm not made for a double life, Raymond.

21
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:54,372
Me neither.

22
00:02:06,556 --> 00:02:12,896
During his stay in France, the Fuhrer
received Monsieur Laval the Foreign Minister,
and Maréchal Pétain.

23
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:16,806
The two French statesmen were given
full military honours.

24
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:49,703
I can't live without you.

25
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:26,555
Sarah, do you know the best ?

26
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:32,019
Monsieur and I decided to go
to the cinema at the last moment.
Well, do you know. The show was cancelled.

27
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:34,244
The hooligans began whistling the Maréchal.

28
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,920
They had to put the lights on in the hall.
There was a scuffle. It was ridiculous.

29
00:04:40,048 --> 00:04:42,655
Actually, have you mended my blue jacket ?
It's getting cold.

30
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:44,176
No. I haven't had time, Madame.

31
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,001
It's OK, thank you.

32
00:04:49,337 --> 00:04:51,237
Not had time !

33
00:04:51,778 --> 00:04:53,778
Not had the time. She's impertinent, that girl !

34
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:56,118
She's young.

35
00:04:56,143 --> 00:04:57,946
When I was young, I knew how to conduct myself.

36
00:04:57,971 --> 00:05:00,083
Obviously the wine is bad for your memory.

37
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,321
No, but I don't know...

38
00:05:06,652 --> 00:05:08,552
...you saw how she talks to me.

39
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:10,491
Did you see how she looks at me.

40
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:12,316
I feel no respect.

41
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:15,022
You're right. I'll talk to her.

42
00:05:31,638 --> 00:05:34,028
You're making soup ?

43
00:05:37,975 --> 00:05:42,118
You know, about just now...
If Madame finds out I was
at the cinema, she'll sack me.

44
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:45,643
You didn't see me or anything, right ?

45
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:47,044
Monsieur, I saw nothing...

46
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:48,891
...since I wasn't there !

47
00:06:03,808 --> 00:06:04,966
So ?

48
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:08,899
Kommandant, what do you want us to do
about the kids whistling in the cinema ?

49
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:14,124
They're not kids. By chance there was
a Sicherheitdienst man in the hall...

50
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:18,449
...he said he saw a leader
who stood at the back of the hall...

51
00:06:18,474 --> 00:06:20,174
...and shouted slogans.

52
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,501
Your Policeman couldn't identify this leader ?

53
00:06:24,526 --> 00:06:27,426
No. He was in the company of a lady.

54
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:31,541
But he's going to make a report to Besançon.

55
00:06:32,732 --> 00:06:36,960
And from tomorrow, I'm going to take tougher measures.

56
00:06:36,985 --> 00:06:39,434
We're really abashed, Kommandant.

57
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:43,032
Send your superiors our most
sincere apologies for this incident.

58
00:06:43,057 --> 00:06:44,957
I don't care about your excuses.

59
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:48,174
What are you going to do about
this outrage against public order ?

60
00:06:48,928 --> 00:06:52,667
I assure you that we'll investigate.
Our Police will do their job.

61
00:06:52,756 --> 00:07:00,210
In Germany the police control agitators.
In Germany, no-one dare whistle the Führer in a cinema.

62
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,161
No way will you write a letter
to the Maréchal.

63
00:07:10,186 --> 00:07:12,669
Why ? All my friends are doing one.

64
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,604
Well, all the more reason not to.

65
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:16,729
But what am I going to say to the Mistress ?

66
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:18,801
Just tell her you have no ideas.

67
00:07:18,826 --> 00:07:22,326
But it's true that I've no ideas.
That's why I'm asking you to help me.

68
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,160
You're not to write a letter.
It's a matter of principle.

69
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:27,109
What's a principle ?

70
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:31,495
Well, it's...

71
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,070
OK, little guy, until tonight.

72
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:36,997
See you tonight, Papa.

73
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,076
I recognize you !

74
00:07:53,262 --> 00:07:55,108
Police!

75
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,843
Police. This guy put Bolshevik
leaflets in letterboxes.

76
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:12,675
Stop !

77
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:17,976
Give them to me. Quick.

78
00:08:19,548 --> 00:08:22,248
Oh! You should be more be careful.

79
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,810
Messieurs.

80
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:28,830
You didn't stop when a policeman whistled you ?

81
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:31,194
I was scared. It's idiotic, I know.

82
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,040
Let me see your bag.

83
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,790
Strange to have a bag with nothing in it.

84
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:45,387
I took my son to school. His things were in it.

85
00:08:48,341 --> 00:08:50,741
Good, It's OK. Go on. Move on.

86
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:02,686
We're not going looking for a kid who
whistled in a cinema. It's ridiculous.

87
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:06,371
We're not asking your opinion Commissaire.
We're asking you to do the job you're paid for.

88
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:09,667
And if he is found, we hand him
over to the Boches ? Like Marek !

89
00:09:09,764 --> 00:09:12,096
You know Marek got 10 years hard labour.

90
00:09:12,171 --> 00:09:16,824
Wait. We shouldn't look for the one who
whistled, or it's impossible to do it ?

91
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,349
Because it's not the same.

92
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:21,935
Finding a kid who whistled
in the dark is impossible.

93
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,574
It's perfectly possible.
Dijon Intelligence have done it several times.

94
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:32,121
Just a bit pressure on those nearby
and witnesses. It's possible.

95
00:09:32,146 --> 00:09:33,646
Ah, we're getting somewhere.

96
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,480
Right. Witnesses, neigbours, pressure.

97
00:09:39,482 --> 00:09:41,487
The Germans are furious. We must do something.

98
00:09:41,512 --> 00:09:46,100
Monsieur le Sous-Préfet.
It's out of the question that the perpetrator
be taken by the Germans this time.

99
00:09:46,513 --> 00:09:49,398
If we find him, we'll judge him.
It remains between Frenchmen.

100
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,299
Listen, we'll do our best.
I want better than that.

101
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,200
I need your word, Monsieur le Sous-Préfet.

102
00:09:56,201 --> 00:09:58,001
My word !

103
00:09:58,002 --> 00:10:02,002
Yes, or else you'll have
my resignation on your desk...

104
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:03,403
...tomorrow morning.

105
00:10:07,404 --> 00:10:10,204
All right. I'll confirm it with Besançon.

106
00:10:10,205 --> 00:10:13,705
Anyway, I'm sure if we find the leader
the Fritz will be content.

107
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:16,106
You have my word.

108
00:10:18,107 --> 00:10:20,607
Make this word stand for something.

109
00:10:27,608 --> 00:10:33,308
I'm taking a risk here. Don't disappoint me.
Shit, this guy still whistled at the Maréchal.

110
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:35,109
And Hitler.

111
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:39,010
De Kervern, the Maréchal is all we have today.

112
00:10:40,011 --> 00:10:44,311
It doesn't please me that the Maréchal
shakes hands with Hitler.

113
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:46,212
But I assume he knows what he's doing.

114
00:10:48,213 --> 00:10:52,113
Good. I'm counting on you.
In theory there are only 48 hours.

115
00:10:53,868 --> 00:10:56,268
Gentlemen !

116
00:11:09,062 --> 00:11:11,075
What are you up to ?

117
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,715
I'm only telling the truth. That's all.

118
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:16,514
Stop bullshitting me with the truth.
I'm not a kid.

119
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:18,967
The truth !

120
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:22,006
I'm asking you not to conduct this investigation.

121
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:28,778
And the Mayor, who's our superior
has just asked us to lead it.

122
00:11:29,512 --> 00:11:32,734
So maybe I should go back and ask him
for confirmation of this order ?

123
00:11:35,176 --> 00:11:37,914
You're on the way to losing your soul, my son.

124
00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:46,559
And you, Gustave, have you started your letter ?

125
00:11:47,092 --> 00:11:48,992
No, Mistress, not yet.

126
00:11:49,026 --> 00:11:51,226
I can hardly hear you, Gustave.

127
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:53,610
No, Mistress, I haven't started it.

128
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:56,209
I have no ideas.

129
00:11:56,765 --> 00:11:59,708
I don't know the Maréchal.
How can I write to him ?

130
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:02,645
How can I, if I don't know the Maréchal ?

131
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,979
We all know the Maréchal.
What did the Maréchal do children ?

132
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:09,501
He made a gift of his person to France.

133
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:12,960
Very good. Have you asked your Papa to help you ?

134
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:15,040
A Papa always has good ideas.

135
00:12:15,977 --> 00:12:18,077
Er...      No, I forgot.

136
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:24,266
You must tell him.
Tell him that next Monday we are going to read
all the letters before the Academic Inspector.

137
00:12:24,474 --> 00:12:29,718
And if you haven't done your letter, I'll have to
speak to the new Headmaster, Monsieur Bériot.
He'll not be at all happy.

138
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:31,751
Did you understand ?
Yes Mistress.

139
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,550
Yes. Good. Sit down.

140
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:06,439
Where can we talk ? At the café ?

141
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:10,041
Certainly not.
In the Post Office ?
Oh no, I prefer not.

142
00:13:10,994 --> 00:13:14,040
There's a cleaning lady,
I don't know what time she arrives.

143
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,550
Wait for me in the courtyard there.
I'll go through the main entrance.

144
00:13:35,462 --> 00:13:37,771
I really wanted to thank you for just now.

145
00:13:37,796 --> 00:13:39,183
It wasn't a big thing.

146
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:42,773
Even so. It was prison if they'd found them on me.

147
00:13:43,116 --> 00:13:44,282
...or on you.

148
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:46,208
How did you know ?

149
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:50,863
Where did you put them ?

150
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:52,790
Well, I burned them.

151
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:56,752
Sorry! But I couldn't take the risk
of someone stumbling on them in the office.

152
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,573
Frankly... to take risks like that for such nonsense !

153
00:14:02,871 --> 00:14:07,538
Against the profiteers of London and Vichy.
Join the Communists...

154
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,358
...have you nothing else to say to people ?

155
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:12,044
You're for the Profiteers ?
No.

156
00:14:12,237 --> 00:14:15,454
But to put London and Vichy in the same class. It's....

157
00:14:17,495 --> 00:14:18,895
...I can't find the right word.

158
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,820
.. its Communist !

159
00:14:26,748 --> 00:14:27,861
Is it the cleaning lady ?

160
00:14:27,886 --> 00:14:29,932
No, she doesn't have keys to the back door.

161
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:41,064
Listen. I'm ready to do something.
Monday is the 11th of November.
It will be an opportunity...

162
00:14:41,424 --> 00:14:43,640
I've an idea for massively distributing a flyer...

163
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:45,822
...but we have to call a spade a spade.

164
00:14:46,064 --> 00:14:47,464
Meaning ?

165
00:14:48,934 --> 00:14:51,063
The Boches              Out with them.

166
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:56,222
I don't know. I'll have to talk to the Comrades.

167
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:00,959
I'm Marcel Larcher.

168
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,534
Suzanne Richard.

169
00:15:05,473 --> 00:15:07,165
Where were you in the hall ?

170
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,490
In the sixth Row.

171
00:15:08,515 --> 00:15:10,015
In the centre.

172
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,910
Always in the centre, Inspecteur.

173
00:15:11,972 --> 00:15:14,872
And when there was the noise, did you turn ?

174
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:18,073
Obviously. But I didn't see who whistled.

175
00:15:18,074 --> 00:15:19,885
But you saw people.

176
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:21,939
Towards the last row.

177
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,916
Vaguely.

178
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:26,681
Can you give me their names.

179
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:29,016
That way, they can tell us who whistled.

180
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:31,226
I didn't have a good view, you know.

181
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,461
Listen Monsieur Camille, I haven't all day.

182
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:39,469
I need to find names. And unfortunately
if you don't give me any I'll be forced
to believe it was you who whistled.

183
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:43,179
Oh ! I wouldn't have the courage.

184
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:54,869
I remember...in the last row
there was the little Schwartz maid...

185
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:56,747
Sarah.

186
00:15:56,771 --> 00:15:59,912
It surprised me because Monday's her day off, so...

187
00:15:59,937 --> 00:16:03,448
...I wondered how she'd arranged
to be at the cinema on a Sunday.

188
00:16:04,511 --> 00:16:05,416
And she whistled ?

189
00:16:05,441 --> 00:16:10,101
No. I think she was, well...
perhaps she was with those who whistled...

190
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:15,345
...but I'm not sure of it.
In any case she didn't whistle.

191
00:16:17,732 --> 00:16:22,365
I say, I wouldn't like to hurt little Sarah.

192
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,160
She's really nice for a Jew.

193
00:16:33,304 --> 00:16:34,361
Sarah isn't here ?

194
00:16:34,386 --> 00:16:36,026
It's Monday.

195
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:40,287
It tires me thinking about caulking windows.

196
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:41,912
Couldn't she do it before leaving ?

197
00:16:41,937 --> 00:16:43,685
You only have to ask.

198
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,380
Good evening Monsieur Schwartz.
Inspecteur ?

199
00:16:52,507 --> 00:16:54,507
Please come in.
Thank you.

200
00:16:54,898 --> 00:16:57,372
I'm sorry to bother you.

201
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:01,075
It is about your servant, Sarah Meyer.

202
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:02,700
She's not here. I believe.

203
00:17:02,701 --> 00:17:04,501
No. This is her half day off.

204
00:17:04,502 --> 00:17:07,993
That's what they said. Madame.
Monsieur.

205
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,587
Would you have seen her at the cinema,
at the Mairie, last night ?

206
00:17:11,612 --> 00:17:14,706
Certainly not. During her work hours !

207
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:16,681
You're sure ?

208
00:17:16,706 --> 00:17:18,464
Obviously !

209
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:21,615
Moreover, we were there.
Oh good !

210
00:17:22,353 --> 00:17:24,647
And when they whistled, did you see anything ?

211
00:17:25,004 --> 00:17:28,031
Oh no. I was in the toilet.
When I came back, the room was all lit up...

212
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,610
...and the agitators were gone, I believe.

213
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:33,225
Good! And you ?

214
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,350
I was watching the screen,
and afterwards I didn't see very much.

215
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,465
But you have reason to think
Sarah was at the cinema yesterday ?

216
00:17:42,556 --> 00:17:44,522
Sorry. I can't tell you any more.

217
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:48,412
Can you ask her to come to the Commissariat,
first thing in the morning ?

218
00:17:48,655 --> 00:17:50,759
Of course.
Very well.

219
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:53,717
 Sorry for the inconvenience.

220
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:56,812
Good evening.

221
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,834
Good evening.

222
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:05,200
He seems to think that Sarah was at the cinema yesterday.
If she's done such a thing I'll give her a weeks notice.

223
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:06,837
We would have seen her!

224
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:08,996
Say it. We would have seen her all the same !

225
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:12,028
Obviously, yes.

226
00:18:14,449 --> 00:18:16,167
Raymond ?

227
00:18:16,527 --> 00:18:19,127
You saw her at the cinema yesterday ?
No.

228
00:18:22,207 --> 00:18:24,007
Tell me the truth.

229
00:18:24,255 --> 00:18:26,155
Wait, Jeanine, what are you talking about ?

230
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:31,986
When you went to the toilet it lasted far too long.

231
00:18:34,582 --> 00:18:36,051
You went to find her.
You've made Sarah your mistress.

232
00:18:36,076 --> 00:18:37,410
You're crazy.
Sarah !

233
00:18:37,435 --> 00:18:40,568
Swear on Marceau's head.
Sarah's not your mistress.

234
00:18:41,402 --> 00:18:43,525
Jeanine!
Swear it.

235
00:18:44,844 --> 00:18:49,044
I swear on the Marceau's head
that Sarah's not my mistress.

236
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:06,350
Going OK ?

237
00:19:06,921 --> 00:19:08,386
No.

238
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:10,878
I've redone the accounts.

239
00:19:11,468 --> 00:19:12,702
They don't work out.

240
00:19:12,786 --> 00:19:14,586
Oh...You're exaggerating.

241
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:17,703
We been indebted for many years.

242
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:22,951
We are far from being in debt. In any event, my
parents, my grandparents always were.

243
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,060
There's something wrong.

244
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:28,596
You didn't pay rent to Monsieur Schwartz
for the last quarter ?

245
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:31,833
Yes. In fact...

246
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:36,655
The bank was closed during the refugee exodus.
It was complicated. I was....

247
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,058
...unable to pay it. I've arranged it with him.

248
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,625
Arranged ?
How ?

249
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:50,278
You know he's a rich employer.
He told me to pay when I could pay...
when everything's back in order.

250
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,800
Well, everything is back in order.

251
00:19:54,253 --> 00:19:55,450
I came back.
Yes.

252
00:19:55,475 --> 00:19:57,046
...but I couldn't have imagined.

253
00:19:59,794 --> 00:20:01,991
Did he say about the interest ?

254
00:20:03,054 --> 00:20:05,954
No. In fact, he told me you two would talk about it.

255
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:22,671
Sarah.

256
00:20:22,815 --> 00:20:24,615
It's Monsieur Schwartz.

257
00:20:25,802 --> 00:20:28,742
Sarah, open the door.
It'll only take a few minutes.
I want to talk to you.

258
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,192
I can't just now.

259
00:20:31,841 --> 00:20:35,111
Listen, the Police came to question me about you last night.
Open it for me.

260
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:44,027
No ! Are you crazy Sarah ?

261
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:46,252
If Madame had caught you ?
It's not what you think.

262
00:20:46,737 --> 00:20:48,982
I was forced to sleep here.

263
00:20:49,366 --> 00:20:50,862
Aren't you Bellini's son ?

264
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:53,323
You won't talk to Madame ?

265
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,754
Listen, I'm not here. You weren't at the cinema.
Agree ?

266
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,409
But you say that the Police came.
Is it about the Jewish Census ?

267
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:04,386
No. They came to investigate
the incident at the cinema yesterday.

268
00:21:05,952 --> 00:21:07,667
They want you at the Commissariat this morning.

269
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:09,284
But what to do ?

270
00:21:09,563 --> 00:21:11,863
I was just about to ask that question.

271
00:21:14,498 --> 00:21:17,098
You were with her at the cinema ?

272
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,064
And so ?

273
00:21:20,776 --> 00:21:22,676
It was you who whistled.

274
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:27,927
It doesn't concern me.

275
00:21:28,815 --> 00:21:32,158
...but I told them you weren't at the cinema.
So don't go contradicting me.

276
00:21:32,813 --> 00:21:34,566
Are you crazy, or what ?

277
00:21:34,757 --> 00:21:38,072
Your Head Post Mistress is Suzanne Richard,
the wife of Lucien Richard

278
00:21:38,114 --> 00:21:40,455
The guy of the SFIO. The French Section
of the Workers International !

279
00:21:40,524 --> 00:21:42,722
You made a deal with a Social-Fascist traitor, Comrade.

280
00:21:42,747 --> 00:21:44,265
You're exaggerating. She saved the situation.

281
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,895
Exactly !

282
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,620
That's what's suspicious.

283
00:21:47,687 --> 00:21:50,553
First, she saves the situation,
and then, afterwards, like....

284
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:56,209
Afterwards, by chance, she proposes an action.

285
00:21:56,831 --> 00:21:59,160
It smells like a clear police provocation...

286
00:21:59,161 --> 00:22:01,627
You must cease all contact with her immediately.

287
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:03,488
I feel she's sincere.

288
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:08,597
As for the idea of organising an action
on November 11th, the Party will have nothing
to do patriotic celebrations.

289
00:22:08,731 --> 00:22:12,388
Moreover, it doesn't surprise me that
a Social-Fascist traitor would want
to enroll you in this kind of behaviour...

290
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:14,114
...anti-Party.

291
00:22:14,238 --> 00:22:18,941
At our next meeting, I expect self-criticism
in good and due form from you, Comrade.

292
00:22:19,048 --> 00:22:23,548
You've just proved that you poorly appreciate
the Party's strategic position at a crucial time.

293
00:22:26,462 --> 00:22:28,783
I'll have to make a report
to the Interregional Committee.

294
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:33,693
And I don't want to hear any more
of this action on November 11th.

295
00:22:56,912 --> 00:22:59,172
Good day Mademoiselle.
Inspecteur.

296
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:07,797
Please, sit down.

297
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:12,897
Don't worry. I'm seeing you
just as a matter of routine.

298
00:23:12,922 --> 00:23:14,702
Ah good.

299
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:26,803
Can you tell me about your Sunday afternoon ?

300
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:28,232
What were you doing ?

301
00:23:28,257 --> 00:23:31,082
Well...what time ?

302
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:34,685
Let's say between 6pm and 8pm.

303
00:23:36,835 --> 00:23:41,415
Well, my employers, Monsieur and Madame Schwartz
had gone to the cinema...

304
00:23:41,574 --> 00:23:46,144
I darned socks, caulked windows...

305
00:23:46,471 --> 00:23:47,863
...that's it.

306
00:23:48,858 --> 00:23:50,625
But all that doesn't take two hours.

307
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,989
There were lots of socks perhaps.

308
00:23:53,362 --> 00:23:55,521
I prepared dinner of course.

309
00:23:55,782 --> 00:24:00,130
And then, but you mustn't tell Madame Schwartz,
I was reading.

310
00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:03,906
A novel. Do you know Martin Eden ?

311
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:05,565
No. I never read.

312
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,655
...apart from police reports.

313
00:24:09,674 --> 00:24:13,290
Do you know Camille Hutzinger ?

314
00:24:14,601 --> 00:24:16,054
Yes, a little.

315
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:17,936
He says that he knows you well.

316
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:19,677
He loves you too.

317
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:27,492
She often lets me have her place in queues,
and is nice for a Jew.

318
00:24:32,145 --> 00:24:33,945
He was at the cinema on Sunday.

319
00:24:34,134 --> 00:24:38,365
He placed you there, while you were reading...
Martin Eden.
There you are !

320
00:24:38,818 --> 00:24:40,618
He said he recognized you.

321
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:42,718
Near the last row.

322
00:24:42,998 --> 00:24:44,798
He has poor eyesight.

323
00:24:44,838 --> 00:24:46,838
He knows you.
Which compensates for that.

324
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:50,961
I tell you I didn't go out yesterday.

325
00:24:53,454 --> 00:24:55,545
The cashier remembers you.

326
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:58,930
She thinks you weren't alone,
but she didn't see who you were with.

327
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,499
Listen, Sarah...

328
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:07,364
You're Jewish.

329
00:25:07,653 --> 00:25:09,727
You didn't identify yourself in the Census.

330
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,956
You went to the cinema, fooling your boss.

331
00:25:12,146 --> 00:25:14,173
You lied to the Police.

332
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:17,958
You're in bad trouble here.

333
00:25:20,411 --> 00:25:22,718
So help me to help you.

334
00:25:22,811 --> 00:25:25,258
It's not worth losing your place with the Schwartz,

335
00:25:25,283 --> 00:25:28,631
Your peace of mind, maybe even your freedom.

336
00:25:33,135 --> 00:25:35,735
Sarah, you were in the cinema on Sunday.

337
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,568
Yes or no ?

338
00:25:38,899 --> 00:25:40,599
Yes.

339
00:25:42,156 --> 00:25:43,656
With a man ?

340
00:25:44,425 --> 00:25:45,627
Yes.

341
00:25:45,665 --> 00:25:46,896
But he didn't whistle !

342
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:47,630
I swear it.

343
00:25:47,655 --> 00:25:49,527
No. No. I understand. I believe you.

344
00:25:51,961 --> 00:25:53,761
Just give me his name.

345
00:25:53,903 --> 00:25:56,803
So that he can confirm your testimony.

346
00:25:58,781 --> 00:26:01,081
It's only matter of routine.

347
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:07,942
Michel...Michel Bellini.

348
00:26:10,546 --> 00:26:14,488
Son of the President of the Chamber of Commerce ?

349
00:26:34,227 --> 00:26:36,279
I can't get to work!

350
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,306
I hitched up the ox...

351
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:41,462
...and I said to myself, what use is it all ?

352
00:26:41,487 --> 00:26:45,600
I don't understand you.
You've never thought like this before.

353
00:26:45,651 --> 00:26:49,651
But since then, there's been a war, Marie.
All for what ?

354
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:04,803
Hey, you've moved the chest.

355
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,100
Yes. Don't you think it makes more space ?

356
00:27:10,297 --> 00:27:12,097
How did you move it ?

357
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,416
That chest is heavy !

358
00:27:14,568 --> 00:27:18,168
Some cattle dealers who came to take the sheep.

359
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,737
One of them helped me.
They came on the stroke of eleven.

360
00:27:22,048 --> 00:27:23,764
It's true it weighs a lot.

361
00:27:25,396 --> 00:27:27,910
Which one ?
Which one ?

362
00:27:29,043 --> 00:27:31,043
Which of the cattle merchants helped you ?

363
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,345
Alibert.

364
00:27:37,225 --> 00:27:41,705
That poor guy. He was killed in a
bombing raid at the end of May. Didn't I tell you ?

365
00:27:42,672 --> 00:27:44,404
Poor Alibert !

366
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,919
All these guys croaked for nothing !

367
00:27:50,491 --> 00:27:52,628
Wasn't Alibert re-repatriated ?

368
00:27:53,913 --> 00:27:56,213
I saw him limping when I left.

369
00:28:07,802 --> 00:28:09,814
How are you Monsieur Germain.
Good day.

370
00:28:09,996 --> 00:28:11,319
What do you want ?

371
00:28:11,344 --> 00:28:14,509
Ah well. I'm here for the monthly Requisition.

372
00:28:16,114 --> 00:28:17,726
Didn't you read the letters we sent you ?

373
00:28:17,751 --> 00:28:19,300
I told you about it.

374
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,212
Why can't you leave us with what we have.

375
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:26,147
We need to give you something more ? Is that it?

376
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:28,018
A horse and a pig.

377
00:28:28,251 --> 00:28:30,346
A horse and a pig. You don't want my wife as well ?

378
00:28:30,371 --> 00:28:35,178
Laurin !
Monsieur Germain it's not personal,
it's a question of solidarity...

379
00:28:35,203 --> 00:28:37,354
...with those who have nothing.
And if I give you my horse...

380
00:28:37,388 --> 00:28:41,983
...I will have less to care for.
And if I have less to care for, in the spring
there'll be nothing left to requisition.

381
00:28:42,008 --> 00:28:43,008
Laurin !

382
00:28:43,033 --> 00:28:45,168
It is not me that makes up the rules and quotas.

383
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:47,181
Ah that's it. It's not you. It's not you....

384
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:50,770
It's never anyone, eh ?
But you take a commission, right ?

385
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:53,059
Well, in the past it's been normal !

386
00:28:53,084 --> 00:28:55,984
In the past.
I'm going to knock you into the past, I am.

387
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,585
Bastard.

388
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,731
No. Stop it!

389
00:29:16,346 --> 00:29:18,246
Go on. Get out !

390
00:29:18,288 --> 00:29:20,219
Get out.

391
00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:27,530
That bastard won't come near again.

392
00:29:27,555 --> 00:29:30,619
It's not him who'll come back,
if you carry on like this, it's the Gendarmes.

393
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,536
What's your plan for November 11th ?

394
00:29:33,871 --> 00:29:35,971
You've spoken to the Comrades ?

395
00:29:37,202 --> 00:29:38,602
Yes.

396
00:29:38,807 --> 00:29:40,161
And what did they say ?

397
00:29:40,186 --> 00:29:42,329
I'll tell you when you've told me about your plan.

398
00:29:43,002 --> 00:29:44,902
You're not a joker ?

399
00:29:46,046 --> 00:29:47,556
No.

400
00:29:47,998 --> 00:29:51,598
My plan is to shower Villeneuve
with flyers like this one.

401
00:29:51,877 --> 00:29:55,189
...on which you can write whatever you like.

402
00:29:55,349 --> 00:29:57,317
Getting them delivered
along with 'The Villeneuvois'.

403
00:29:57,342 --> 00:29:58,999
There are 1500 subscribers.

404
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:04,254
Around 4 am, the papers are left
in front of the Sayolle depot.

405
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:07,007
I pick them up every other week.
On Monday the 11th it's my turn.

406
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:12,104
If I make a detour between here and Sayolle,
there's an hour to slide them under the wrappers.

407
00:30:12,962 --> 00:30:14,376
Afterwards, I carry them here.

408
00:30:14,401 --> 00:30:19,707
And 2 hours later, 1,500 Villeneuvois
have their flyer with breakfast.

409
00:30:20,905 --> 00:30:23,305
But the cops will figure out
immediately where they came from.

410
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:26,914
Hello, Madame Morvandieu.

411
00:30:27,824 --> 00:30:29,324
Good day.

412
00:30:29,847 --> 00:30:32,693
She's a work colleague, and she's very nice.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

413
00:30:32,718 --> 00:30:34,718
We need to find another place for a rendezvous.

414
00:30:34,743 --> 00:30:36,873
But where ?
We'll see.

415
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:40,761
How are you going to do it so the cops don't
figure out straight away how it was done ?

416
00:30:40,817 --> 00:30:44,217
The papers lie in front of the
Sayolles depot for 2 hours unattended.

417
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,322
Anyone can come and slide stuff in !

418
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:50,070
Aren't there people who sleep near the depot ?

419
00:30:50,095 --> 00:30:51,595
It's absolutely deserted.

420
00:30:52,134 --> 00:30:54,034
The Boches and cops aren't far ?
No.

421
00:30:55,774 --> 00:30:58,451
The Comrades told me I should
cease all contact with you.

422
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:07,157
But I want to do something.

423
00:31:07,526 --> 00:31:09,534
I think your plan could work.

424
00:31:10,414 --> 00:31:12,214
I'm sure of it.

425
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:18,050
When you talked to me of a meal tête à tête,
I imagined a place more...

426
00:31:19,257 --> 00:31:21,696
Yes, but I'm constantly on duty.

427
00:31:22,234 --> 00:31:25,122
My colleague is obsessed with
his cinema investigation, so...

428
00:31:26,826 --> 00:31:29,025
They should decorate those who whistled !

429
00:31:29,461 --> 00:31:30,961
Let's not exaggerate.

430
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:33,586
It's not good ?

431
00:31:33,611 --> 00:31:35,211
Yes, yes it's delicious.

432
00:31:35,236 --> 00:31:36,836
Did you find it on the black market.

433
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,839
Oh, no. I don't buy anything
on the black market. Really

434
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:40,764
I only arrest those who do.

435
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:43,259
Are you serious ?

436
00:31:43,816 --> 00:31:45,716
Never completely. No.

437
00:31:46,401 --> 00:31:49,635
So, you're OK in the strangler's flat ?

438
00:31:50,668 --> 00:31:52,924
Do you want to give me nightmares.

439
00:31:55,035 --> 00:31:56,741
And the job ?

440
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:58,705
It is a substitute, sewing.

441
00:31:58,738 --> 00:32:01,988
First, because I'm not as good
as I thought, and especially...

442
00:32:02,013 --> 00:32:06,115
I didn't think that dozens of women
would have the same idea as me.

443
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:11,568
You know how to type ?

444
00:32:11,593 --> 00:32:12,810
Yes.

445
00:32:12,863 --> 00:32:14,763
I need a part-time Assistant.

446
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,819
Madame Sabourin is going to leave us
to join her family in the Lot.

447
00:32:19,073 --> 00:32:21,573
You know, I haven't ceased being
Jewish after three weeks.

448
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:25,920
But this is a contract position for one year.

449
00:32:26,394 --> 00:32:29,163
The Statute of Jews doesn't apply to contractors.

450
00:32:34,784 --> 00:32:37,175
Why are you doing this for me, Commissaire ?

451
00:32:37,328 --> 00:32:38,939
Henri.

452
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:41,574
Why are you doing this for me, Henri ?

453
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:02,219
I wanted to ask you something...
Henri ?
Henri !

454
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:05,992
Do you think I should
register myself as Jewish or not ?

455
00:33:07,684 --> 00:33:10,389
Yes. You should do it.
It'll save you troubles.

456
00:33:11,362 --> 00:33:14,714
And now they've revoked you,
what more do you risk ?

457
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:21,244
How's it going ?

458
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:22,769
It's not. No.

459
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:25,516
We still have problems with the last Fritz order.

460
00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:28,061
Ah, they pay well, but they're so boring.

461
00:33:28,577 --> 00:33:30,560
With them, it's simple, things never go well.

462
00:33:30,707 --> 00:33:32,844
Perhaps that's how they won the war.

463
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:38,463
By the way, the Mayor of Essart called.
It seems there's a problem with the tenants.

464
00:33:38,614 --> 00:33:39,461
What problem ?

465
00:33:39,486 --> 00:33:43,542
Something about a Requisition. I think Laurin
was raving. He even waved his gun at them.

466
00:33:43,915 --> 00:33:45,909
No-one was injured ?
No.

467
00:33:45,934 --> 00:33:48,567
But the Mayor plans to send the Gendarmes.

468
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:51,789
You may need to think of getting him out.

469
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,513
Wait...

470
00:33:56,697 --> 00:33:58,360
OK, I'll go and see them tomorrow.

471
00:33:58,385 --> 00:33:59,987
Very good.

472
00:34:50,416 --> 00:34:52,334
Laurin isn't here ?

473
00:34:53,306 --> 00:34:56,602
He's in the top field. He'll have heard the car.
He won't be long.

474
00:35:01,227 --> 00:35:03,333
Don't worry. We wont talk about that.

475
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:07,086
What's happened ?

476
00:35:07,754 --> 00:35:10,049
Laurin isn't the same since he returned.

477
00:35:11,218 --> 00:35:13,929
I went to see the Mayor of Essart. It's fixed.

478
00:35:14,305 --> 00:35:16,875
He calmed down when he realized
that I worked for the Wehrmacht.

479
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,468
You always do that !

480
00:35:18,568 --> 00:35:20,252
You got rid of the gun ?

481
00:35:20,277 --> 00:35:22,199
Yes, but we must talk about the rents.

482
00:35:22,224 --> 00:35:24,449
Rents ?
Ah, Monsieur Schwartz !

483
00:35:27,313 --> 00:35:29,419
Glad to see you.
Likewise.

484
00:35:29,771 --> 00:35:31,786
Hey, you need to cool things
a little there with Garnier.

485
00:35:31,811 --> 00:35:35,798
Ah, that's OK. I've already had
a lecture from the boss.

486
00:35:39,086 --> 00:35:41,998
Say, without wanting to trouble you...

487
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:45,144
...I'd like you to give me a hand.

488
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,037
There's a pig to dress.

489
00:35:48,197 --> 00:35:50,230
It's easier with three.

490
00:35:59,018 --> 00:36:00,240
Go on. Marie !

491
00:36:00,265 --> 00:36:01,765
Go and get the bucket.

492
00:36:03,408 --> 00:36:04,879
That's good.

493
00:36:05,052 --> 00:36:06,310
Bring the bucket here.

494
00:36:06,335 --> 00:36:08,135
Come on, let's go.

495
00:36:14,754 --> 00:36:16,809
You know what, Monsieur Schwartz.

496
00:36:16,861 --> 00:36:20,938
When I go away with Marie...
I need you, Laurin.

497
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,766
You're the best tenant I ever had.

498
00:36:29,681 --> 00:36:31,823
Look out.

499
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,538
With the Requisitions, the debts,
all that, we have to go Monsieur Schwartz.

500
00:36:53,397 --> 00:36:55,997
With all the money we owe you !

501
00:36:55,998 --> 00:36:57,740
Money, what money ?

502
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,399
The rents.

503
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,700
Yes, the rents and well...

504
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:04,701
You told me you'd arrange with Laurin
about the interest on what we owe you.

505
00:37:04,702 --> 00:37:07,002
Don't worry, I'm in no hurry.

506
00:37:07,003 --> 00:37:10,257
But what interest rate will you charge.
That's what worries us.

507
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,278
Right, listen, I don't know.
All I know is that...

508
00:37:12,303 --> 00:37:15,302
I know a way you can earn not bad money.

509
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:18,266
I don't see how.

510
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:19,191
Well, your pig...

511
00:37:19,216 --> 00:37:21,021
It's an average one.

512
00:37:22,222 --> 00:37:25,230
I'll only get 20 francs maximum at the Salins Market

513
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:29,907
Yes. Well I'll go see a worker who's
marrying off his daughter on Sunday.
I can get 1,000 francs minimum.

514
00:37:40,392 --> 00:37:42,892
Hello,Raymond.
Good day, are you well ?

515
00:37:46,577 --> 00:37:47,977
It's okay, you can go.

516
00:37:48,002 --> 00:37:49,573
And, Good day.

517
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:07,949
Good Evening Herr Schwartz.
So, how was your Leave ?

518
00:38:08,348 --> 00:38:13,376
Very good but not long enough.
Too short.

519
00:38:13,401 --> 00:38:16,680
Ja, short.
And Greta and the children are well ?

520
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,400
Ja, they would like me to return home.

521
00:38:19,592 --> 00:38:22,552
Ah, yes. Can I go now ?
Ja.

522
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,159
Ah, but wait, Greta gave me a present. I'll show you.

523
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,142
Kom Willie! Kom hop-hop!

524
00:38:40,172 --> 00:38:42,192
This is Willie.

525
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,784
Say hello to Monsieur Schwartz.

526
00:38:45,591 --> 00:38:48,811
Oh yes, yes. Very beautiful !
Willie ?

527
00:38:51,551 --> 00:38:53,418
He's not stupid.

528
00:38:55,024 --> 00:38:57,324
Herr Schwartz, are you carrying something ?

529
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,373
Her Schwartz ?

530
00:39:00,566 --> 00:39:03,290
A side of pork for sauerkraut, interested in some ?

531
00:39:03,499 --> 00:39:05,557
Herr Schwartz !

532
00:39:10,049 --> 00:39:12,555
And how would you still have wine like this ?
It's extraordinary.

533
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,469
Isn't it very expensive ?

534
00:39:13,494 --> 00:39:14,694
It's true it's not bad.

535
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:16,673
We still have a good cellar.

536
00:39:16,903 --> 00:39:18,607
You were telling me that you had news ?

537
00:39:18,632 --> 00:39:22,339
The Fritz are becoming unbearable.
It's Inspecteur Marchetti that has the news.

538
00:39:22,364 --> 00:39:24,538
Well, I actually identified a suspect.

539
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:27,185
Formidable ! He admits the facts ?

540
00:39:27,482 --> 00:39:30,935
Well I don't know that as yet. Commissaire
de Kervern doesn't want me to interview him.

541
00:39:31,466 --> 00:39:34,866
What does he mean by that ?
He wasn't sober for the whole of June...

542
00:39:35,472 --> 00:39:37,772
Is he a Freemason or not ?

543
00:39:38,551 --> 00:39:42,577
Anyway, the guy is brave man
and a good Commissaire.

544
00:39:42,823 --> 00:39:46,695
Yes, but what we need today
are brave men with a nuance.

545
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,588
You're going to arrest this suspect.
I'll give you a written order.

546
00:39:49,613 --> 00:39:50,321
Very good.

547
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,083
What's he called ?

548
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:52,790
Michel Bellini.

549
00:39:57,018 --> 00:39:59,813
They were surely other persons whistling ?

550
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:00,838
Maybe.

551
00:40:00,863 --> 00:40:04,258
But I think Bellini is the ring leader
we're looking for.

552
00:40:07,919 --> 00:40:11,219
Well, you can interview him but not arrest him.

553
00:40:13,935 --> 00:40:15,922
May I know why Monsieur Sous-Préfet ?

554
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:18,811
Inspecteur ! 
Let it go.

555
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,250
I know the Bellini father personally,
but that's not the problem.

556
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:28,375
He's a notable. If you arrest his son,
you arrest an enemy of Public Order.
But at the same time...

557
00:40:28,505 --> 00:40:31,787
...you undermine the good society
which is a basis of Public Order.

558
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:33,940
Do you understand ?

559
00:40:35,691 --> 00:40:37,853
Let me take care of the child.

560
00:40:42,446 --> 00:40:45,416
Don't get me wrong,
but I'm not totally in agreement with you.

561
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:49,043
Do you know why Pétain's
Montoire agreement is going wrong ?

562
00:40:49,665 --> 00:40:52,482
Because everything's going wrong,
The prisoners of war aren't returning.

563
00:40:52,525 --> 00:40:54,397
Provisions are scarce.

564
00:40:54,422 --> 00:40:56,936
The Germans are going to stay,
for how long we don't know.

565
00:40:57,091 --> 00:40:59,783
The Maréchal shook Hitler's hand,
and no-one even knows why.

566
00:40:59,808 --> 00:41:02,458
To stall for time, obviously. It's a ruse.

567
00:41:02,641 --> 00:41:03,572
Let him continue.

568
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:05,349
If we want to get the spirit of Montoire
across to people, here's the message...

569
00:41:05,374 --> 00:41:07,872
We need to get it across
to the people of Villeneuve today.

570
00:41:08,626 --> 00:41:12,213
We're going to make Order prevail
without distinction of wealth...

571
00:41:12,284 --> 00:41:13,757
...birth, class, or anything...

572
00:41:13,782 --> 00:41:20,882
...just Order. If you let the son of a notable
go scot-free, it will put us back six months.

573
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:25,822
He's dead right.

574
00:41:27,036 --> 00:41:29,795
Very good. You've convinced me.
You have carte blanche.

575
00:41:30,664 --> 00:41:32,288
Thank you.

576
00:41:33,078 --> 00:41:35,078
So is Montoire going so badly ?

577
00:41:35,103 --> 00:41:37,303
It's true people don't understand it.

578
00:41:37,716 --> 00:41:41,736
To meet with Hitler, that's one thing.
But to shake his hand !

579
00:41:45,187 --> 00:41:48,287
That was really clumsy, I'm sorry.

580
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,190
I apologize.

581
00:42:15,931 --> 00:42:18,531
These political lunches don't bore you too much ?

582
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,570
No more than you.

583
00:42:52,947 --> 00:42:55,095
Will you pour me one ?

584
00:43:01,872 --> 00:43:03,672
Thank you.

585
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:08,513
What is that.
Are you in the black market Raymond ?

586
00:43:08,807 --> 00:43:11,175
I'm helping Marie and Laurin
who are a bit strapped right now.

587
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,183
Ah, you're helping Marie and Laurin...

588
00:43:14,714 --> 00:43:17,954
Marie...and Laurin...

589
00:43:21,175 --> 00:43:24,575
That's good...we should help people.

590
00:43:25,537 --> 00:43:27,537
You know I was scared yesterday.

591
00:43:28,712 --> 00:43:33,055
Stamler had brought a dog from Dusseldorf.
The dog smelled the meat.

592
00:43:33,451 --> 00:43:36,851
It was lucky that von Ritter
wanted a real sauerkraut, or else...

593
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:41,735
Besides, it would be nice to pack
the pieces to sell to Lévrier.

594
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:44,834
What portion is this ?

595
00:43:45,482 --> 00:43:47,572
Is it the shoulder ?

596
00:43:53,611 --> 00:43:55,199
What do you take it for ?

597
00:43:55,224 --> 00:43:57,842
What do I take it for ?
You ask me what I take it for.

598
00:43:57,867 --> 00:44:00,966
You, going to smooch with your mistress
in the cinema toilet !

599
00:44:01,569 --> 00:44:03,459
What are you talking about ?

600
00:44:03,484 --> 00:44:05,810
Oh, fine. Sarah told me everything.

601
00:44:08,399 --> 00:44:10,799
She came back from the Commissariat in tears.

602
00:44:11,594 --> 00:44:14,026
She was with her boyfriend at the cinema...

603
00:44:14,547 --> 00:44:16,680
...and everything else.

604
00:44:18,144 --> 00:44:21,049
You're making that into a wrong I did to you ?

605
00:44:23,011 --> 00:44:26,074
...a wrong you did to me, to me...

606
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,640
.. and Marceau and Papa.

607
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:33,134
If Papa knew that.

608
00:44:37,969 --> 00:44:39,903
I don't know who told you this,
but it's completely false.

609
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:42,828
That's just going on lying...

610
00:44:45,852 --> 00:44:47,448
Stop it ! Shut up.

611
00:44:47,473 --> 00:44:48,273
You stop !

612
00:44:48,298 --> 00:44:49,801
Stop it.

613
00:44:50,182 --> 00:44:54,882
If you don't get rid of her I'll tell Papa,
and you can say goodbye to your factory.

614
00:44:55,106 --> 00:44:57,106
And your son at the same time.

615
00:44:57,367 --> 00:44:59,267
Jeannine, I want you to calm down.

616
00:44:59,292 --> 00:45:01,681
Madame. Madame...

617
00:45:03,512 --> 00:45:07,312
My parents have written about
the Jewish Census and...

618
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:09,869
.. they say I have to go there.

619
00:45:10,033 --> 00:45:15,065
If you want to go, Sarah, go ahead...

620
00:45:15,518 --> 00:45:17,042
Yes, but the deadline is today.

621
00:45:17,067 --> 00:45:20,616
Oh no, you not going to miss
another half day's work.
That's enough.

622
00:45:21,192 --> 00:45:24,474
You'll have to go during your day off.
It will be near enough for a Jewess !

623
00:45:24,499 --> 00:45:26,299
Leave us.
Leave us.

624
00:45:30,474 --> 00:45:33,905
I want you to get rid of this slut,
do you hear me ?

625
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,930
I want you to get rid of her.

626
00:45:51,006 --> 00:45:52,906
You're happy.

627
00:45:52,931 --> 00:45:55,631
Yes. But you should be happy too.

628
00:45:56,908 --> 00:45:59,437
The Germans are renouncing any sanctions,
and have confirmed to Servier that...

629
00:45:59,462 --> 00:46:02,061
...they'll let our Judges deal with the case.

630
00:46:02,841 --> 00:46:04,641
It's worse.

631
00:46:05,618 --> 00:46:07,518
Hold on. I'm not following you there.

632
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:09,925
Yes. I know.

633
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:16,731
Where were you on Sunday at 6 pm ?

634
00:46:17,885 --> 00:46:19,737
At the cinema.

635
00:46:23,626 --> 00:46:25,847
Do you remember when people whistled ?

636
00:46:27,873 --> 00:46:29,795
You're saying that I whistled ?

637
00:46:30,845 --> 00:46:33,336
Wait...you admit the facts ?

638
00:46:34,853 --> 00:46:37,195
I didn't know it was forbidden
to whistle in cinemas.

639
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,220
It's forbidden to whistle at the Maréchal.

640
00:46:39,245 --> 00:46:41,131
It was Hitler that I whistled at.

641
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:44,865
It's not my fault that he was
shaking hands with Pétain.

642
00:46:50,896 --> 00:46:53,531
Go on, empty your pockets on the desktop.

643
00:47:02,091 --> 00:47:03,286
What's this ?

644
00:47:03,311 --> 00:47:04,916
An address book.

645
00:47:05,018 --> 00:47:07,272
...with lots of girl's first names.

646
00:47:17,741 --> 00:47:19,541
You speak Spanish ?

647
00:47:19,566 --> 00:47:21,266
No.

648
00:47:22,441 --> 00:47:24,650
It's something I found on a corpse at the church.

649
00:47:26,642 --> 00:47:29,007
I thought she no longer needed it.

650
00:47:35,731 --> 00:47:37,331
Did you read this ?

651
00:47:37,497 --> 00:47:39,597
I told you, I don't speak Spanish.

652
00:47:43,306 --> 00:47:45,606
It's not pretty to loot the dead.

653
00:47:46,068 --> 00:47:48,399
I didn't loot it, they were taking her
to the common grave.

654
00:47:50,859 --> 00:47:53,444
Now listen, you made a big mistake
whistling at the Maréchal.

655
00:47:54,433 --> 00:47:59,633
But OK. You're young, so this time,
we'll let you go.

656
00:48:02,019 --> 00:48:03,722
But don't try it again.

657
00:48:03,747 --> 00:48:05,501
Because next time, it'll cost you very dearly.

658
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:07,346
Do you understand that ?

659
00:48:15,918 --> 00:48:17,731
I'm keeping this.

660
00:48:29,064 --> 00:48:31,290
Now its me who doesn't understand you.

661
00:48:32,503 --> 00:48:35,086
Well, it'll be a pleasure for the Sous-Préfet.

662
00:48:55,792 --> 00:48:57,692
Ah, Inspecteur.

663
00:48:57,717 --> 00:48:59,817
It seems you've released little Bellini.

664
00:49:00,968 --> 00:49:04,710
I just dressed him down a bit.
The Germans were glad we'd found him, and then...

665
00:49:04,922 --> 00:49:08,258
...I said to myself that we shouldn't
go too hard so as to please the Sous-Préfet.

666
00:49:09,051 --> 00:49:10,954
You'll go far, Marchetti.

667
00:49:11,764 --> 00:49:14,464
I'll leave you.
I haven't finished my consultations.

668
00:49:18,275 --> 00:49:20,075
Go ahead please.

669
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,040
Madame Larcher ?

670
00:49:38,572 --> 00:49:40,462
I have something for you.

671
00:49:40,803 --> 00:49:41,916
For me ?
Yes.

672
00:49:41,941 --> 00:49:43,349
Take this.

673
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:48,042
It belonged to the woman
who gave birth to Te Quiero.

674
00:49:53,254 --> 00:49:55,372
I found it during an investigation.

675
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,710
It's her. He has her eyes.

676
00:50:14,871 --> 00:50:16,171
Yes.

677
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:27,081
Thank you !
